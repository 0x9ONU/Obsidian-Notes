## Happy Friday!!!

## Paper
- Going to attempt to push myself and get section 4 done as well today, but I cannot guarantee it
- Seems like I can start section 4, but definitely not going to be able to fix it.

## VM Fix
- I am going to attempt to fix the virtual machine with everything on it. If not, I am going to reinstall everything on a fresh VM.
- Suddenly, everything just magically worked. I am not sure why the vm disconnected from the internet in the first place, but it works now
- Giving it an upgrade at the moment and then I am going to install the proper drivers.

## $\Theta \chi$ Discord Roles
- After work, I am going to put all the proper committee stuff so it is done a week before the retreat
- Sent out final reminder before the committees are changed
