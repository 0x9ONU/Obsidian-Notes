Unlike previous years, there will be a twist: the main character will be female and will focus on gett

## Main Goal

- The retor 70s and 80s game The Oregon Trail taought a generation about a significant hisotrical event int he US: the beginning of westward expansion
- While the game has achieved cult-like status, it does not exuse its many falws concerning stereotypes

## Audience and Client

- This game was designed for 3rd-5th graders
- So the audience for the game is this target range
- The client for the game is the ECCS1621 Faculty and TAs
- PG!

## In the Original Game

- Main character was male
- The wife and duaghter did not "do" anything (except get hurt or sick)
- There was nothign about preparing food, childcare, clothing and mending
- Major "action" of the game was hunting for food
- **WE WANT TO AVOID THESE STEREOTYPES**
