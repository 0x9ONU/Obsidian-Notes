# Basic Sort Algorithms

## Why are We Covering Sorting?

- OFten data must be "sorted' into some order
- It is common to need to scan through an array or rearrange the contents into a specific order

```ad-example
- Sroting cutomer lists into alphabetical order
- Student grades sorted from highest to lowest
- Product codes sorted so same color products are stored together
```

## The 3 Basic Sorts

#comebacklater to get java code

### Selection Sort

- Consiered one of the "basic" sorting (and a popular one)
- The name is because it selects the smallest or largest element in the colleciton at each pass

```ad-warning
Is not efficient at all
```

### Bubble Sort

- Swap out of order "pairs" of array indexes reptively until teh array is sorted
- Easy to recognize when you are close to being completed witht eh soritng algorithm or not

### Insertion Sort
