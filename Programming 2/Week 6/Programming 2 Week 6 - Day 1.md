# Class Design Using CRC Cards

The most difficult problem in teaching OOP porgramming is getting the learner to give up the global knowledge of contorl taht is possible with procedural programs and rely on the local knowledge of objects to accomplish their tasks. Novice designs are littered with regrsssions to global thinking: gratuitious global variables, unnecessary pointers, and inappropriate reliance on the implementation of other objects

**A popular way to decide which class is reponsible for each method is throught he use of *CRC Cards*

```ad-summary

- Class - The name fo the class
- Responsibilities - What the class is reponsible for doing
- Collaborations - What other classes the class collaborates with.
```

	1. Identify as many potential classes that may be in the problem domain and write them in a candiate class list.
2. Filiter and Refine List
