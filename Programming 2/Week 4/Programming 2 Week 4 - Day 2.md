	//Variables or attributes. Repeat as needed
	private (data type) (nouns) = (default value);
	
	//Constructors. NOTE: does not have a return type
	public (same noun as class)() {
		//brilliant code goes here if needed
		//defualt values or setup
	}
	
	//overloading Constructor 
	public (same noun as class) ((data type) (nouns)) {
		//default values and setup, with some values provided by other parts of the program
	}
	
	//getters andsetters
	
	//setter
	public void set(noun)((data type) (noun)) {
		//assigns one values to another somewhere in the code
		this.(noun) = (noun);
	}
	
	//getter
	public (data type) get(noun)() {
		return this.(noun);
	} 
	
	//other methods. Implement the features of the class
