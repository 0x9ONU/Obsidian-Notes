	String color = "";
	//Continue with variables for other features

}
```

public class Student 
{
	//Data variables
	
	//Constructor
	
	//Getters and Setter (accessors and mutators)
	
	//Other methods (funtionality)
}
```

```java
public class Student 
{
	//Data Variables
	private String name;
	private int ID;
	
	//Constructors
	public Student() {this.name = "Klodike Bear"; this.ID = 0;} //default constructor
	public Studnet(String name, int ID) {htis.name = name; this.ID = ID;} //
