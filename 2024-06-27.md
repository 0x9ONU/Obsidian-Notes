## Electronics
- Main focus today
- Trying to figure out a lot of things and hopefully do well at doing them. Really want to solve the boundary resistor mystery.

### Report
- Found that the equations works well at determining the starting and stopping point just how it was
- Could not find the correlation yet, but I am still working on it

## Cybersecurity
- Going to attempt to capture data today, and if everything goes to plan, I will be happy.

## Daily Thoughts
- Still no working WIFI except when connected to ethernet, which is VERY annoying
- like come on it has been over 24 hours since the internet has been out do your job
