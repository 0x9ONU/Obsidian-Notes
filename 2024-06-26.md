## Cybersecurity

### Capture Virtual Machine Fixes
- Transfer all old files from the busted virtual machine to the new one
- This will finally allow capturing on outside networks

### Attackers Virtual Machine
- Setup attacking machines with our favorite DoS tools

### Packet Catching
- Probe and DoS attacks will be ran against each of these attacks

## Electronics

### DAC
- Because of the limits provided by the Arduino’s analog pins, we have to use digital pins alongside an DAC to get it to work
- I came up with a voltage divider solution, but it may not work
- Therefore, further research has to be done into it today

### Lab setup
- Finalize lab setup that I started yesterday
- If it does not work, begin work on other DAC designs.
- If we can get the DAC to work, start putting together the APS RC Circuit with the MOSFET and start testing the waveforms.

## Daily Thoughts
- I hate this school sometimes. I need WIFI to do my job and I do not have access to it since 9 in the morning. 
- It really makes me angry since it is keeping how much I can work at a time and look into things online.
- Have to use hotspot to get any work done.
