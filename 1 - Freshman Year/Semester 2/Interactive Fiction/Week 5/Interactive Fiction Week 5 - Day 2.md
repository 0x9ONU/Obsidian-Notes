- Peer Review
```

## Why we do it?

- Multiple Viewpoints
- Develops yur "editorial eye"
	- makes you a better and more attentive reader;
- Checks taht outside readers understand what you're trying to do;
- Prepares you for the real world
	- the ability to work in teams is the number 1 characteristic employers look for in college grades
	- the percentage of films with 2-3 credited writers has risen voer time
	- collaboration is even more important for game writers

## How do you make peer reviews work?

- Create a culture of encouragement and collaboration in the team. The point is not to "correct' someone's story, but to help each other maek every teammember's stories and games better.
- Begin and end with justified praise. Lots of it. What worked?
- But praise in the middle too.

```ad-note
Be specific. What do you think works? What doesn't work? Explain why?
```

## How do you knwo what to focus on?

- Ask the writer what s/he wants help with first.
- Remeber the story/assignment constriants. What are the goals of the project/assignment?

## Formatting a Critique

- Critqieus comprise two parts:

| An overview that gives the reviewer's main feedback on what worked and what didn't. | Specific comments inserted in Word highlighting particular areas for praise or work. |
