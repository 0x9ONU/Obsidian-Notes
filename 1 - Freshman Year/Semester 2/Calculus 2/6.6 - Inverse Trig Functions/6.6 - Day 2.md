## Inverse of $\tan{x}$

$\tan{x} = y$ if and *only* iif $\tan{y} = x$

However, $\tan{x}$ is not a one to one function and would not have an inverse under normal circumstances.

```ad-important
When restricted to $[-\frac{\pi}{2}, \frac{\pi}{2}]$, $\tan{x}$ becomes one to one
```

```ad-note
- $\lim_{x \to -\infty} tan^-1(x) = -\frac{\pi}{2}$
- $\lim_{x \to \infty} tan^-1(x) = \frac{\pi}{2}$
- $tan^-1(tan(x)) = x$ for all $x$ in $[-\frac{\pi}{2}, \frac{\pi}{2}]$
- $tan(tan^-1(x)) = x$ for all $x$ in $[-\infty, \infty]$
```

### Derivate of $tan^-1(x)$

$$ \frac{d}{dx}(tan^-1(x)) = \frac{1}{1+x^2}$$

## Inverse of $csc(x)$

$y = csc^-1(x)$ where $\left|x\right| \ge 1$ if and only if $csc(y) = x$
**AND** $y$ belongs to $(0, \frac{\pi}{2}] U (\pi, \frac{3\pi}{2}]$

## Inverse of $sec(x)$

$y = csc^-1(x) where $\left|x\right| \ge 1$ if and only if $sec(y) = x$
**AND** $y$ belongs to $[0, \frac{\pi}{2}) U [\pi, \frac{3\pi}{2})$

## Inverse of $cot(x)$

$y = cot^-1(x)$ if and only if $cot(y) = x$
**AND** y belongs to $(0, \pi)$

# Derivatives of Inverse Trigometric Functions

1. $$\frac{d}{dx}(sin^-1(x)) = \frac{1}{\sqrt{1-x^2}}$$
2. $$\frac{d}{dx}(cos^-1(x)) = \frac{-1}{\sqrt{1-x^2}}$$
3. $$\frac{d}{dx}(sec^-1(x)) = \frac{1}{x\sqrt{x^2-1}}$$
4.  $$\frac{d}{dx}(csc^-1(x)) = \frac{-1}{x\sqrt{x^2-1}}$$
5. $$\frac{d}{dx}(tan^-1(x)) = \frac{1}{1+x^2}$$
6. $$\frac{d}{dx}(cot^-1(x)) = \frac{-1}{1+x^2}$$
```ad-note
- Derivative of $cos^-1$ is the same as $sin^-1$ but negative
- Derivative of $csc^-1$ is the same as $sec^-1$ but negative
- Derivative of $cot^-1$ is the same as $tan^-1$ but negative
```

# Solving for Inverse Trigometric Functions

```ad-question
### Evaluate: $sin^-1(\frac{1}{2})$

```ad-check
title: Solution
- Let $sin^-1(\frac{1}{2}) = y$
	- Setup for property
- $sin(y) = \frac{1}{2}$
	- Use property to substitute the inverse with the regular
- $y = \frac{\pi}{6}$
	- Use unit circle to find value
```

```ad-question
### Evaluate: $tan(arcsin(\frac{1}{3}))$

```ad-check
title: Solution
- Let $arcsin(\frac{1}{3}) = \theta$
	- Setup for substitution inside the $tan$
- $sin(\theta) = \frac{1}{3}$\
	- Use substitution to change inverse sin to sin
- $A^2 + B^2 = C^2$ where $A=1$ and $C=3$
	- Utilize Pothagrean Theorem to find the Adjacent Side
- $(1)^2 + B^2 = (3)^2$
	- Substitute $A$ and $C$
- $B^2 = 8$
	- Square values and subtract 1 from both sides to get $B^2$ alone
- $B = 2\sqrt{2}$
	- Take the square root of both sides to get equation in terms of $B$
- $tan(\theta) = \frac{1}{2\sqrt{2}}$
	- Because every side of the triangle was found, $tan$ can be found as opposite over adjacent. (Aka $tan = \frac{A}{B}$)
