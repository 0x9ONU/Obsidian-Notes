# Indefinite Integration by Parts

Use integration by parts when there are two different functions in the form $u*dv$ and $dv$ is not the derivative of *u*. 
Much like a product rule for integration, it allows two different functions to be simplified and their integral can eventually be taken.

```ad-important
### Formula for Integration by Parts: $\int udv = uv - \int vdu$
```



## Examples

```ad-example
#### Find $\int xe^xdx$

```ad-check
title: solution
- $u = x$, so $du = dx$ **AND** $dv = e^xdex$, so $v = e^x$
	- Setup the problem for integration by parts
	- We choose $x$ as our $u$ as the derivative of $x$ is just $dx$, which often is the best step for integration by parts problems
- Because $\int udv = uv - \int vdu$, then $xe^x - \int e^xdx$
	- By using the integration by parts formula, replace $u$, $v$, and $du$ with their respective values
	- From here, we are able to integrate the inner function much easier.
- $xe^x - e^x + C$
	- Since the value of $\int e^xdx$ is just $e^x$, the integral can be solved and the final answer is found
```

```ad-note
**Always** try to find a $u$ where $du$ is a less significant term. The remainding term is your $dv$.
```

### Using Integration by parts multiple times

```ad-question
### Find $\int x^2sin(x)dx$
```ad-check
title: Solution
- Let $u = x^2$ and $dv = sin(x)dx$, so $du = 2xdx$ and $v = -cosx$
	- Set $x$ to $u$ in an attempt to reduce it down to $dx$
	- Set the remainding part of the integral to $dv$ and integrate to get $v$
- Because $\int udv = uv - \int vdu$, then $-x^2cos(x) + 2\int xcos(x)dx$
	- Repalce the variables of the integration by parts formula
	- NOTE: the negative and 2 from $v$ was taken out of the integral to make the problem more simplified
- For $/int xcos(x)dx$: $u = x$ and $dv = cos(x)dx$, so $du = dx$ and $v = sin(x)dx$
	- The integral that was created by the last integration by parts cannot be solved, so we take integration by parts again to find a new value for the integral.
	- $u$ and $dv$ are utilized again, but have nothing to do with the previous integration by parts.
- Because $\int udv = uv - \int vdu$, then $-x^2cos(x) + 2[xsin(x)) - \int sin(x)dx]$
	- Plug the new integration by parts back into the integral of the old equaiton.
	- Because this new integral is able to be integrated, the new value of this integral is able to be found.
- $-x^2cos(x) + 2xsin(x) - 2\int sin(x)dx$
	- Distribute 2
- $-x^2cosx + 2xsin(x) +2cosx + C$
	- The final answer
	- The integral of $\int sin(x)dx$ is $-cos(x)+C$ and is the only integral that is taken in this equaiton.
```

### When $u$ does not simplify down to a proper $du$

```ad-important
For problems like this, utilize for when the integral created by the 2nd integration by parts becomes the same as the original integral.
```


```ad-question
#### Find \int e^xsin(x)dex
```ad-check
title: Solution
- Let $u = sin(x)$ and $dv = e^xdx$, so $du = cos(x)dx$ and $v = e^x$
	- We choose sin(x) as the derivative as we know that after taking the integral twice, sin(x) becomes -sin(x)
	- $e^xdx$ is chosen as the $dv$ as it stays consistent no matter how much it is integrated.
- Because $\int udv = uv - \int vdu$, then $e^xsin(x) - \int e^xcos(x)dx$
	- By using the integration by parts formula, you get the following equaiton
- Let $u = cos(x)$ and $dv = e^xdx$, so $du = -sin(x)dx$ and $v = e^x$
	- Prepare integration by parts again using similar reasoning to the previous.
- Because $\int udv = uv - \int vdu$, then $e^xsin(x) - [e^xcos(x) + \int e^xsin(x)]$
	- By taking the 2nd integration by parts, you get two terms with a single integral
- $\int e^xsin(x)dx = e^xsin(x) - e^xcos(x) - \int e^xsin(x)dx$$
	- Set the equation we found equal to the original integral
	- Because the integral on the left is equal to the integral on the right, we are able to combine them like a variable
- $2\int e^xsin(x)dx = e^xsin(x) - e^xcos(x)$
	- Add the integral to both sides to cancel it out on the right side
- $\int e^xsin(x)dx = \frac{e^xsin(x)-e^xcos(x)}{2} +C$
	- Divide both sides by 2 to get the final answer
```


# Definite Integration by Parts

### $$\int_{a}^{b} udv = [uv]_{a}^{b} - \int_{a}^{b} vdv$$
```

## Example

```ad-question
### Find $\int_{0}^{1} xe^xdx$

```ad-check
title: solution
- Let $u = x$ and $dv = 3^x$, so $du=dx$ and $v = \frac{3^x}{ln(3)}$
	- $u$ is set to $x$ as it can be reduced down to $dx$
	- $v$ is found by using the integration formula $\int a^x = \frac{a^x}{ln(a)}$
- Because$\int_{a}^{b} udv = [uv]_{a}^{b} - \int_{a}^{b} vdv$, then $\frac{1}{ln(3)}[x3^x]_{0}^{1} - \frac{1}{ln(3)} \int_{0}^{1} 3^xdx$
	- Because it is a definite integral, both the outside term and the integral are bound by the original $a$ and $b$
- $\frac{1}{ln(3)}[x3^x]_{0}^{1} - \frac{1}{ln(3)}[\frac{3^x}{ln(3)}]_{0}^{1}$
	- Integrate the integral to get the final equation before the 2nd fundamental theorum of calculus is used.
- $\frac{1}{3}([(1)*3^(1)] - [0 * 3^0] - [\frac{3^(1)}{ln(3)} - \frac{3^(0)}{ln3}])$
	- Take both $frac{1}{ln(3)}$ coefficients and move them to the front and put them under a single quantity to make the math easier.
	- Use 2nd Fundamental Theorem of Calclus to find the value of the definite integral
- $\frac{1}{ln(3)}[3-\frac{2}{ln(3)}]$
	- Simplify to get the final answer
