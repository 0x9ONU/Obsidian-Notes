# Indeterminate Forms

```ad-important
To solve indeterminate forms of the remainding types, utilize the following:
$$\lim_{x \to 0} x^x = \lim_{x \to 0} e^{ln(x^x)} = e^{\lim_{x \to 0} xln(x)}$$
```

## Example

```ad-question
#### Find $\lim_{x \to 0^+} x^{\sqrt{x}}$

```ad-check
- $(0)^{\sqrt{(0)}} = 0^0$
	- When $x$ is replaced by $0$ on the right side to find the limit, it comes into $0^0$ indeterminate form.
- $\lim_{x \to 0^+} e^{ln(x^{\sqrt{x}})}$
	- Take the entire equation to the e$^{ln()}$ to get a workable format
- $e^{\lim_{x \to 0^+}ln{x^{\sqrt{x}}}}$
	- Because $e$ is a constant, move the limit into the inside of the $e$
	- NOTE: in the following, the $e$ will be ignored until the very end
- $\lim_{x \to 0^+} \sqrt{x}ln(x) = 0 * \infty$ form
	- By using logarithm rules, write the exponent of the logarithm on the outside 
	- However, by doing this, it is still in an indeterminate form.
- $\lim_{x \to 0^+} \frac{ln(x)}{\frac{1}{\sqrt{x}}}
	- Move the reciprocal of $\sqrt{x}$ to the bottom.
	- By doing this, when solving for the limit, indeterminate form $\frac{\infty}{\infty}$ is found
	- L' Hospital's Rule can now be taken
- $\lim_{x \to 0^+} \frac{\frac{1}{x}}{\frac{-1}{2x^{\frac{3}{2}}}}$
	- Take the derivatives of both the top and the bottom
- $\lim_{x \to 0^+} -2x^{\frac{1}{2}} = 0$
	- Simplify and apply the limit
- $e^0 = 1$
	- Replace this answer back into the first equation to get the final limit
