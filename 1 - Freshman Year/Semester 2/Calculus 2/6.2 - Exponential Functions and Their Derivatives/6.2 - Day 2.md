# Limits of Exponential Functions

```ad-summary
title: Exponentially Increasing

If $b\ge 1$ , then $$\lim_{x \to \infty} b^x = \infty$$ AND 
$$\lim_{x \to -\infty} b^x = 0$$

```

```ad-question
Find $\lim_{x\to\infty} (2^{-x} - 1)$

```ad-check
title: Solution
- $\lim_{x\to\infty} (2^{-x}) - 1$
	- constant remains unaffected by the limit
- $\lim_{x\to\infty} (\frac{1}{2})^x - 1$
	- Take receprical to change $b^{-x}$ to $(\frac{1}{b})^x$
- $(0) - 1$
	- The limit when $0 < b < 1$ as $x$ approaches $\infty$ = 0
- $\lim_{x\to\infty} (2^{-x} - 1)$ = -1
```

# Rules of Exponential Functions

If $a$, $b > 0$ and $x, y  \epsilon$ all real number then:

$$b^{x+y} = b^xb^y$$
$$b^{x-y} = \frac{b^x}{b^y}$$
$$(b^x)^y = b^{xy}$$
$$(ab)^x = a^xb^x$$

# Proving the number $e$

## Defintion of Derivative

To find $f'(x)$ before we know its rules, we must use the **definition of derivative** to solve for $f'(x)$


```ad-note
The definition of derivative is as shown:

$$f'(x) = \lim_{h \to 0} \frac{f(x+h)-f(x)}{h}$$
```


$f(x) = b^x$ replaces $f(x+h)$ and $f(x)$ in the definition of derivative:
$$f'(x) = \lim_{h \to 0} \frac{b^{x+h}-b^x}{h}$$

Use the **properties of exponents** to fix power:

$$f'(x) = \lim_{h \to 0} \frac{b^xb^h-b^x}{h}$$
Take out common factor $b^x$:

$$f'(x) = \lim_{h \to 0} (\frac{b^h-1}{h}) b^x$$

**From here, $b^x$ reflects $f(x)$ and can be replaced:**


$$f'(x) = \lim_{h \to 0} (\frac{b^h-1}{h}) f(x)$$

```ad-important
Derivative of exponential function will be a constant number times itself THUS the derivative of exponential number is **proportionate** to itself ($f'(x)$ for all of $f(x)$)

```

At $x=0$, the $b^x$ becomes one and disappears and creates a function that will always exist for $b < 0$:

$$f'(0) = \lim_{h \to 0} \frac{b^h-1}{h}$$

From this equation, we are able to find the different values of $b$ at $f'(x) = 0$:

| h       | $\frac{2^h-1}{h}$ | $\frac{3^h-1}{h}$ |
| ------- | ---------------- | ---------------- |
| 0.1     | 0.71773          | 1.16123          |
| 0.01    | 0.69556          | 1.10467          |
| 0.001   | 0.69339          | 1.0992           |
| 0.0001  | 0.69317          | 1.09867          |
| 0.00001 | 0.69315          | 1.09862          |


```ad-summary
For different values of $b$, the limit apporaches towards different values:
- For $b = 2$, $f'(0) = \lim_{h \to 0} \frac{2^h-1}{h} \approx 0.693$
- For $b = 3$, $f'(0) = \lim_{h \to 0} \frac{3^h-1}{h} \approx 1.098$
```

From the formula earlier:

$$f'(x) = \lim_{h \to 0} (\frac{b^h-1}{h}) f(x)$$

We can gain the following equations:

$$\frac{d}{dx}(2^x) \approx (0.693)2^x$$
AND

$$\frac{d}{dx}(3^x) \approx (1.098)3^x$$

# Definition of the number $e$

```ad-important
color: 255, 255, 0
Of all possible choice for the case $b$, the *simplest* differentiation formula occurs when **$f'(0) = 1$**
```


Let $e$ be a **Fixed Real Number*** such that $2 < e < 3$ and:

$$\lim_{h \to 0} \frac{e^h-1}{h} = 1$$
