# Class Design Using CRC Cards

The most difficult problem in teaching OOP porgramming is getting the learner to give up the global knowledge of contorl taht is possible with procedural programs and rely on the local knowledge of objects to accomplish their tasks. Novice designs are littered with regrsssions to global thinking: gratuitious global variables, unnecessary pointers, and inappropriate reliance on the implementation of other objects

**A popular way to decide which class is reponsible for each method is throught he use of *CRC Cards*

```ad-summary
title: CRC refers to:
- Class - The name of the class
	- A collection of similar objects
- Responsibilities - What the class is reponsible for doing
	- What class knows or does 
- Collaborations - What other classes the class collaborates with.
	- Addtional classes that are interacted with to fulfull responsibilities
```

# CRC card Process

1. *Brainstorming*
	1. Identify as many potential classes that may be in the problem domain and write them in a candiate class list.
2. Filiter and Refine List
	1. Review the list you created in step 1 and come up with a refined list.
3. Identify responsbilities and collaborations using scenarios
	1. From the revised list, create CRC cards
4. Identify responsibilities and collaborations using scenarios
	1. Develop scenarios that will occur and play out the scenario to identify responsibilities and collaborations.
5. Finalize classes
	1. Throw out any cards  that do not have any responsibilities and collarborations.
