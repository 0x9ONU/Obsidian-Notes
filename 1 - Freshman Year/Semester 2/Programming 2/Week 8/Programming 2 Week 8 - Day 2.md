# Importance of Images

Images will be used thorughout the college career 

BUT you can not just take them without giving credit.

# Options for using Images Correctly

## Option 1: Making your own

- You own the copyright and you can use them in anyway you like
- To make your own images, use:
	- Illustrations:
		- Drawings
		- Paintings
		- Collage
		- Digital Tools
- Photography
	- Taking your own photos is easy and can be your own
	- Be careful, **You might need permission**
	- When you do not:
		- When it is a photo of an object
		- a person at a public event and is used for editorial purposes
		- A photo of a person that is not recognizable
	- When you *do*:
		- Recognizable photo of a person *and* you are going to use it for commercial or promotional purposes
		-   Taken at a private event or place
	- When you **might** need permission
		- The photo is taken of students in school
		- The photo was taken in a store or contains a company logo

### How to get permission?

Have the person sign a photo release form, which gives you legal permission to use their likeness in your images

## Option 2: Creative Commons Images

- They are a company that has artists that give out free-to-use licenses
- If you find images that have the CC watermark on them, you already know that you may use them.
- Different Meanings of the Watermark
	- **BY attribution**: you must say who the work is by
	- **SA aka Sharealike**: You need to give your new product the same license as the image
	- **NC Non-Commercial**: You may not use the image to make money
	- **ND No Derivatives**: You may not make any changes to the image
