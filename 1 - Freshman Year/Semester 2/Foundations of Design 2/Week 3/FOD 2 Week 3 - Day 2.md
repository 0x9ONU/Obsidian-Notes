### Review: Concept Reduction

- Voting
- Pro/Con
- Weighted Decision Matrix

# Functional Decomposition Review

Considering a project topic:

- Identify a list of key *fucnitons* that a solution to your need might have
- Use various strategies to generate several *features* to perfrom each function

## Function vs Feature

A function is a goal or objective accomplished by a product

A feature is a tool that helps acheive functions

```ad-note
- If you can draw it, it is a **feature** not a function
- If you can measure it, it is a metric and note a function
```


### Generating Founctional Areas Examples

#### Toaster

```ad-check
title: Good Toaster Functions
- User interface, heat soruce, load/unlaod method, housing
```

```ad-danger
title: Bad Toaster Functions
- Dial, Toast ejection (both of these are over-defining)
```


#### Bike

```ad-check
title: Good Bike Functions
- Braking, Propulsion, Settering, SUspension, Road/Vehicle Interface
```

```ad-danger
title: Bad Bike Functions
- Wheel size, handlebars, pedals, chains
```


# Concept Generation Methods

- Brainstorming
- Asking Experts
- Prior Art
- Bio-mimicry
- Looking at it differently
- Explore idea combinations
- Collaborative sketching
- Impromptu prototyping (prototyping)

## Brainstorming

Producing an idea via a spontaneous *group* discussion

**Individually** generate dieas then share with teammates
- Record each idea
- Include 1-2 setnence description and/or sketches each

*Bulidng off your teammates' Idea*

## Collaborative Sketching

Generate dieas using sketches, depicting your ideas through very simple visual models

Procedure:

1. Everyone starts with some brainstormed design concept
2. Pick a coner of the page and start sketching your brainstormed idea
3. Rotate the poster 90 degrees and start adding your teammte's drawing
4. Rotate again
5. Rotate again
6. Rotate one last time
7. Discuss Results

## Prior Art

Using currently existing prodcuts for inspiration

Can also include:
- Published articles
- Patents
- Public demonstrations

```ad-danger
Do NOT rely too heavily on prior art
Leads to "design fixation"
```

## Bio-mimicry

Seeking inspiration in nature

"An approach to innovaiton that seeks ustainable solutions to human challegnes by emulating nature's time-tested patterns and strategies"

## Explore Combinations

Looking at similar/related ideas

Consider quesitons like...
- Are there other similar contexts that might provide ideas?
- How might I repurpose this concept in the context of my problem?

## Look at is differently

Taking a different perspective

Consider questions like:
- Could we consdier a different approach?
- How do other cultures view this problem?
