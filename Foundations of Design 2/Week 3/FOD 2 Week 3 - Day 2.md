# Functional Decomposition Review

Considering a project topic:

- Identify a list of key *fucnitons* that a solution to your need might have
- Use various strategies to generate several *features* to perfrom each function

## Function vs Feature

A function is a goal or objective accomplished by a product

A feature is a working COME BACK

```ad-note
- If you can draw it, it is a **feature** not a function
- If you can measure it, it is a metric and note a function
```
