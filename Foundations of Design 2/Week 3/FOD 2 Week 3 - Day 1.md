# Mistakes on HW1

Pay attention to:

- Pugh's Method
- Assumptions
- Excell
- Scale
	- Units!!
- Keeping tract of units in equations

# Project Scheduling


## Gantt Chart

A common tool for visualizing a project schedule

- ==Tasks==: 
	- **all** individual steps of a project
- ==Timeline==: 
	- when each task begins and ends
- ==Accountability==: 
	- who is responsible for each task
- ==Pre-requisites==: 
	- which tasks must be completed before other tasks begin
- ==Progress==: 
	- which tasks are completed and underway

## Step 1: What steps are required?

Any scheudle must be founded on a clear understading of project **tasks** and key **milestones**

#### Identify what tasks need to be done

```ad-note
Make a list of all work *prioritized in order of completion*
```

#### Make sure to:
- Identify any steps that are *prerequisites* for others
	- must build a prototype before you can test
- Include subtasks
	- Prototype construciton = buying materials + cutting parts + assemplying components

#### Turbine Example

**Senario**: You are overseeing the seledction and installation of a large wind turbine for the City of Findlay.

##### Work Breakdown Structure

```ad-note
Notice how each major task, even though there is relatively on a few of them, has many subtasks
```

## Step 2: Logistical Details

- **When** should each task be completed?
- **When** sare deliverables due to the client?
- **Who** is responsible for each deliverable and each task?
- **How long** will each task take to complete?
- Do any tasks require other tasks to be completed first? 

# Using a Gantt Chart

A gantt chart is a living document that maps out the entire project

**Expect change** in your Gantt chart if tassks need to be modified

### Example Tasks for your flexible Gantt Chart

- Design Notebook
	- Review instructions > started for you in the template
- DR1 - Problem framing + Conceptual Design
	- Review instrucitons > include key tasks
- DR2 - Detialed Design + Intial Testing
	- Include: intial CAD test plan draft, updated low-fi prototype, initial BoM, present
- DR3 - Design Refinement + Experimentation
	- Include: revised CAD, order supplies, test plan, data analysis, initial demonstration prototype, updated BoM, present
- Design Showcase
	- Review RFP
	- Include Polar Innovation Exchange

# Budgetting Time

Why are overly optimistic time estimates a problem?

What factors should be considered when making estimates?

```ad-important

Make sure to budget time for:
- Porject delays
	- weather, sipping, change orders
- Lead time from supplier and sub-constractors
	- material, communciations
- Processing time for non-human resoruces
	- running a simulation
- Physical processes
	- concrete curing, adhesive setting
```
