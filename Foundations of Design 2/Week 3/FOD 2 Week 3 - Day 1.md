# Project Scheduling


## Gantt Chart

A common tool for visualizing a project schedule

- ==Tasks==: 
	- **all** individual steps of a project
- ==Timeline==: 
	- when each task begins and ends
- ==Accountability==:

	- which tasks must be completed before other tasks begin
- ==Progress==: 
	- which tasks are completed and underway

### Step 1: What steps are required?

## Turbine Example

**Senario**: You are overseeing the seledction and installation of a large wind turbine for the City of Findlay.

## Using a Gantt Chart

A gantt chart is a living document that maps out the entire proejct

**Expect change** in your Gantt chart if tassks need to be modified

# Budgetting Time

Why are overly optimistic time estimates a problem?

What factors should be considered when making estimates?

```ad-important

Make sure to budget time for:
