A common tool for visualizing a project schedule

- ==Tasks==: 
	- **all** individual steps of a project
- ==Timeline==: 
	- when each task begins and ends
- ==Accountability==: 
	- who is responsible for each task
- ==Pre-requisites==: 
	- which tasks must be completed before other tasks begin
- ==Progress==: 
	- which tasks are completed and underway
