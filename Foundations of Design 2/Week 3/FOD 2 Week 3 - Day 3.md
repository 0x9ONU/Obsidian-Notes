# Concept Reduciton Methods

- Voting
- Pro-Con
- Pugh's Method

## New Approach : Rank Order

1. Similar to voting except each member ranks all ideas (1 = best)
2. Add all ranks together for a given concept
	1. if a concept is ranekd by four teammates as 1, 2, 2, 1 > total score = 6
3. Lowest scores = winners

## Voting

Quick and approximate deciosn-making approach
- Can have mutliple "winners"

Useful for

Eliminating obvious failures

## Pro/Con

A less detialed reduciton method than a decison matrix, but relatively simple to perform

## Pugh's Method

A type of weighted decsion matrix

Assigns:
- Evaluation metrics to compare options
- Weighting (tool = 100)
- comparison scores (-2, -1, 0, 1, 2)
	- -2 is much worse than baseline
	- -1 a little worse than baseline
	- 0 same as baseline
	- 1 a bit better than baseline
	- 2 much better than baseline

Good for ideas that are realitvely similar

```ad-note
Choose any baseline as it does not matter in the end
```
