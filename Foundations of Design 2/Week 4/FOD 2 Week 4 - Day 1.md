| ------------------------------------------------------ | ----------------------------------------------------------------------------------- |
| Proejct scope is too broad                             | Present a realistic conceptual design sketch, labeled and annotated                 |
| Not meeting at least one per week                      | Meet often and recrod detialed ntoes in agendas                                     |
| Incomplete Gantt Chart                                 | Include tasks and sub-tasks for the entire semester                                 |
| Not identifying proper stakeholders                    |                                                                                     |

| Assumptoins are unclear                                | Use the assumpotion framework                                                       |
| Feedback is conflated with preliminary research        | Research = publications, asking experts / potential stakeholders, experimental data |
| References are poorly formatted                        | Use IEEE formatting                                                                 |
