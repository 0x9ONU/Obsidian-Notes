# Experimentation + Design

```ad-note
In DR2:
- Identify an experiment that explores at least one design feature. The experiment should yield *quantitative* and *qualative* data
```

This data should:
- Be dsiplayed on an appropriate chart
- Informs a design decision

## Types of Experiemntal Tests

**External** design parameter (eg., environemtnal condition)
- Wind turbine: wind speed
- Water filter lab: clarifty of intial water sample

```ad-warning
THese are NOT useful findings:
- "Higher wind speed genreates more power"
- "A cleaner intial water sampel results in clearer filtered water"
```

**Internal** desing parameter (e.g., prototype dimension)
- WInd turbin: # of blades
- Water filter lab: layers of filtration media

```ad-note
Results form these tests allow designers to justify decisions
```
