# Experimentation + Design

```ad-note
In DR2:
- Identify an experiment that explores at least one design feature. The experiment should yield *quantitative* and *qualative* data
```

This data should:
- Be dsiplayed on an appropriate chart
- Informs a design decision

## Types of Experiemntal Tests

**External** design parameter (eg., environemtnal condition)
- Wind turbine: wind speed
- Water filter lab: clarifty of intial water sample

```ad-warning
THese are NOT useful findings:
- "Higher wind speed genreates more power"
- "A cleaner intial water sampel results in clearer filtered water"
```

**Internal** desing parameter (e.g., prototype dimension)
- WInd turbin: # of blades
- Water filter lab: layers of filtration media

```ad-note
Results form these tests allow designers to justify decisions
```

## Types of Experimetnal Tests

**DIscrete** independent variables (e.g. distinct categories)
- Wind turbine: blade shape
- Water filter: type of filtration media

```ad-important
Generates a **column** chart instead of a math model
```

**Continuous** indepndent variables (e.g. quantitative range)
- Wind turbine: blade length
- Water filter lab: thickness of sand

```ad-note
Generates a **Scatter Plot** and a trend line
```

## Types of Experimental Tests

**System Behavior**

- To learn something about the design componeneents, material, assembly, etc.
- Manipulates an indepdent variable to determien relationship with a dependent variable
- Guides design - infroms selection or design of individual compenents

**Prototype Performance**

- Goal: to demonstration the design's performance
- Provides quantitative exvidence of success

# Torque

Torque = Force x Radius

Force acts tangent to the pulley and in the same rotional direction as the torque

```ad-important
title: Torque Formula
### $t = mgr$
```

## Measuring Shaft Speed

$$RPM = \frac{Number of Rev}{min}$$
## Motor System Model

| Inputs | Outputs | Control       | Uncontrollable |
| ------ | ------- | ------------- | -------------- |
| Weight | Time    | Circumference | Friction       |         

## Gear ratios

Comparing "driven gear" to "drive gear":

$$ \frac{N_2}{N_1} = \frac{D_2}{D_1} = \frac{T_2}{T_1} = \frac{RPM_1}{RPM_2}$$

With:
- N = Number of Teeth
- D = Drive
- T = Torque
- RPM = Rotations per Minute
