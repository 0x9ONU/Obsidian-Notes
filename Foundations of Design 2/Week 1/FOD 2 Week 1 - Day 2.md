# Socially Responsible Engineering

The potential to benefit society or advance desired societal outcomes

```ad-example
-  Society
	- Educational opportunities
	- Well-being of individuals
-  Environment
	- Adoption of sustainable practices
	- Conservation of natural resources
- Economy
	- National security so people have faith in their transactions
	- the devleopment of a diverse, globally competitive workforce
```

# Opportunity Recognition

**An opportunity Statement** identifies the user and has a _function_ and a *deliverable*

```ad-important
An opportunity statement is ***NOT*** a statement of the expected solution or product. Make it as broad as possible
```

# Stakeholders

Individuals/groups who will in some significant way be affected by the product development

```ad-tldr
title: Three dimensions of importance:

- Severity
	- How significantly are they affeced by the result?
- Utility
	- To what extent do our design choices depend on their input?
- Capability
	- To what extent are we able to obtain their feedback?
```

# Opportunity Recognition Steps

## Step 1: Stakeholders

Find the msot important stakeholders and consdier their wants, needs, and their situation

## Step 2: Outline the Workspace

What opporutnites exist to improve the lives of someone, somewhere in the world in a meaningful and impactful way?

```ad-warning
Focus on ***Opportunities***, NOT solutions
```

#### Example Questions to Ask:
- Waht sort of tasks do epople perform?
- What hurdles do they encoutner in their day-to-day lives?
- What objects do they interact with? How?
- Waht risks do they face?

## Step 3: Organzie and Reduce

```ad-example
color: 255, 255, 0
## Consider the list of challenges:
- What are the most critical challenges that present an opportunity? For an engineering solution to have an impact?
- Are there any related challenges? If so, what is the bigger opportunity these ideas address?
```

## Step 4: Select and Refine

Reviewing your list, identify one well-crafed opportunity statement, remembering to include:

$$Users(s) + Function + Deliverable$$

# Defining the Opportunity

Begin to design the deleverible

```ad-abstract
title: Definition of Deliverable

- Product or process
- Can be physical or paper/digital
- Can have both:
	- **Form**
		- What the deliverable is or looks like?
	- **Function**
		- What purpose the deliverable serves?
```
