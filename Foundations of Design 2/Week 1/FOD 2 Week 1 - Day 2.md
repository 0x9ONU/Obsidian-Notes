# Information Gathering

The act of gathering different kinds of information about the problem being considered

```ad-important
### 4 ways to generate information
- Asking experts on the subject
- Doing tests and experiments
- Asking people affected
- Doing research in known literature soruces
```

# Assumptions

In order to move a design forward, specific info is often needed

AFTER reviewing relevant literation and asking questions to experts and stakeholders, it migth be the case that this *info is not readily available*

Assumptions are made when a project needs to progress and the  information needed is difficult to find

```ad-danger
title: Warning
Be sure to clearing state **why an assumption matters** to your design.
- If you can't think of anything, it is probably not worth stating.
```

## Common Invalid Assumptions

- The information is readily avaiable
	- ex. The current number of students int eh college is around 600.
- Overly obvious
	- Each classroom should have a place for students to sit
- Outside the proejct scope
	- the building should have a glass and stone facade
- Factually inaccurate

# Constraints

Limitations of a design

When a constraint is not met, it is not a viable solution

```ad-note
*Must* be a Measured Quantity
```

#### Benchmarks

Sepcific performance expectations set by constraints

# Evaluation Metrics

Guidelines to determine a design's level of quailty

Used to compare possible design options to one another

#### Objectives

The preferred performance of the metrics
