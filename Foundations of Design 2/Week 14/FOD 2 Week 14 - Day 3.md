# Good Communication Guidelines

- Clarity
	- Specific nubmers, emanings, and words matter
	- eg. precison is not the same as accuracy and tolerance
- Brevity
	- Get to the point
	- Use appropriate significant figures
	- DO NOT PUT BLOCKS OF TEXT ON A POSTER
	- Summarize them into briefer statements
- Accuracy
	- Cite reliable resources
- Easy to understand
	- Leverage graphics (tables, charts, picutres)

# Communication with Non-Technical Audiences

- No Jargon/technical terms without explaining
- Avoid talking down
- Empathize
- Don't data dump
- Practice the speech
- Engage them on all levels
- Ask for quesiotns and feedback

# Technical Presentation

Should include:
- Numbers/Data

- Drawings

```ad-note
Assume that they also understand the basics of your field
```

```ad-warning
Define acronyms *at least* once.
```

```ad-important
Use common jargon!
```

# Posters vs. Papers

| POSTER = Summary            | PAPER = Details                     |
| --------------------------- | ----------------------------------- |
| Snapshot visual             | Walk-thru of entire design processs |
| Key figures, research, data | All figures and data tables         |
| Aids in your presentation   | All background research             |
|                             | All design specs                                    |
