collapse: open
The market for power-sensitive designs has increased dramatically in recent years, owing to the growing production of devices that are powered by portable batteries. Subthreshold computer architecture has grown in importance as technology scaling continues unabated due to low and ultra-low power applications. The short-channel effect is a significant problem when reducing the gate length to less than 0.1 m. This paper provides a systematic analysis and possible strategies for the emergence of CMOS, which is the leading technology today, as suggested by numerous researchers. In addition, we identify and explain the problems and remedies for low voltage and power applications, providing a foundation for computer developers operating independently in the submicron and deep submicron regions of CMOS systems.
