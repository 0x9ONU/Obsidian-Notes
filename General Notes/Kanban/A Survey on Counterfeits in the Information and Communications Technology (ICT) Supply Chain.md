title: Abstract
collapse: open
One of the major threats to the information and communications technology (ICT) supply chain is the introduction of counterfeit parts and components. Global efforts have been intensified to defend against counterfeiters and counterfeit products due to their detrimental impact on the economy, safety, and security. Among the extensive literature of papers, reviews, books, and articles, this review attempts to include a detailed selection of most significant research work done in the intersection of ICT, supply chains, and counterfeits to provide a reference source for researchers. Citation network and global citation scores have been used to extract and analyze papers and discuss them in different types of clusters (electronic, medical, food, and anti-counterfeiting technologies and approaches). Our review approaches the clustered papers by focusing on (1) their contribution in documenting and modeling the intrusion of counterfeit electronic parts in the ICT supply chain, (2) the proposed counterfeits’ detection and avoidance techniques in the ICT supply chain, and (3) the contribution of ICT in thwarting counterfeits in medical, pharmaceutical, and food supply chains. This review provides a better understanding of the global efforts to address counterfeits in the ICT supply chain, as well as the role of ICT in thwarting counterfeits in other supply chains, which can guide future research to minimize the impact of counterfeits on supply chains.

## Summary

### **1. Introduction**

- As ICT supply chains become more complex and globally distributed, they face growing threats from **counterfeit components**, which can:
    
    - Jeopardize **safety, security, and reliability**
        
    - Cause **economic losses** (~$323B in 2018)
        
    - Lead to **job losses** (~5 million by 2022, projected)
        
- **Deceptive counterfeits**, especially in critical systems (e.g., aerospace, medical, defense), pose high risks like product failures and even deaths.
    
- **Figure 1**: A pie chart showing **industries most affected by counterfeiting**:
    
    - Footwear (23%)
        
    - Clothing (16%)
        
    - Leather goods (13%)
        
    - **Electrical equipment** (12%)
        
    - Medical equipment, pharmaceuticals, toys, perfumes, and jewelry represent lower but critical shares.

### **2. Methodology**

- The study uses the **Scopus database** and **VOSviewer software** to:
    
    - Analyze 900+ relevant publications
        
    - Generate **keyword co-occurrence networks** (Figure 2)
        
    - Build **citation networks** (Figures 3 & 4)
        
- Identifies **4 research clusters**:
    
    1. Counterfeits in electronic/ICT supply chains
        
    2. Medical/pharmaceutical counterfeits
        
    3. Food supply chain counterfeits
        
    4. ICT-enabled anti-counterfeiting technologies

### **3. Counterfeits in Information and Communications Technology (ICT) Supply Chains**

#### **3.1 Documenting and Modeling Counterfeits**

- Organizations like **GIDEP** and **ERAI** serve as watchdogs by tracking and reporting counterfeit components.
    
- Government and industry standards (e.g., U.S. Navy's Guidebook) outline **best practices**:
    
    - Avoid open-market purchases
        
    - Use trusted suppliers
        
    - Third-party component verification
        
- **Modeling approaches**:
    
    - **Agent-based simulation models**
        
    - **Signaling theory** to understand counterfeiters’ deception strategies
        

#### **3.2 Anti-counterfeiting Approaches**

- Detection techniques include:
    
    - **Ring Oscillator (RO)-based signature analysis**
        
    - **Thermal imaging + machine learning**
        
    - **Image texture analysis**
        
    - **Timing characteristics in memory chips**
        
- **Low-cost methods**:
    
    - ML + SVM classifiers
        
    - Clock phase sweep and transient current comparison
        
- **Hardware countermeasures**:
    
    - **PUFs** (Physically Unclonable Functions)
        
    - **Logic locking**
        
    - **Split-Test** for untrusted foundries
        
- **Traceability and authentication**:
    
    - **RFID and blockchain integration**
        
    - Secure hash protocols
        
    - Optical and nanomaterial-based labeling

### **4. ICT-Related Anti-counterfeiting Technologies and Approaches in Other Supply Chains**

#### **4.1 Countermeasures**

- Common across all supply chains:
    
    - **Digital watermarking** (DARPA, personal care)
        
    - **RFID-based authentication systems**
        
    - **Blockchain-backed traceability** for ownership and event logging
        
- RFID-enhanced strategies:
    
    - Applied even to **textiles**
