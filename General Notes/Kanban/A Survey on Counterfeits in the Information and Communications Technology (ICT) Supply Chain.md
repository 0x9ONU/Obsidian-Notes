title: Abstract
collapse: open
One of the major threats to the information and communications technology (ICT) supply chain is the introduction of counterfeit parts and components. Global efforts have been intensified to defend against counterfeiters and counterfeit products due to their detrimental impact on the economy, safety, and security. Among the extensive literature of papers, reviews, books, and articles, this review attempts to include a detailed selection of most significant research work done in the intersection of ICT, supply chains, and counterfeits to provide a reference source for researchers. Citation network and global citation scores have been used to extract and analyze papers and discuss them in different types of clusters (electronic, medical, food, and anti-counterfeiting technologies and approaches). Our review approaches the clustered papers by focusing on (1) their contribution in documenting and modeling the intrusion of counterfeit electronic parts in the ICT supply chain, (2) the proposed counterfeitsâ€™ detection and avoidance techniques in the ICT supply chain, and (3) the contribution of ICT in thwarting counterfeits in medical, pharmaceutical, and food supply chains. This review provides a better understanding of the global efforts to address counterfeits in the ICT supply chain, as well as the role of ICT in thwarting counterfeits in other supply chains, which can guide future research to minimize the impact of counterfeits on supply chains.
