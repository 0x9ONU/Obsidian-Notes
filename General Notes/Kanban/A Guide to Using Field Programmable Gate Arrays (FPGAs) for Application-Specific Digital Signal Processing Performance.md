title: Abstract
collapse: open
FPGAs have become a competitive alternative for high performance DSP applications, previously dominated by
general purpose DSP and ASIC devices. This paper describes the benefits of using an FPGA as a DSP Co-processor, as well as, a stand-alone DSP Engine. Two Case Studies, a Viterbi Decoder and a 16-Tap FIR Filter are used to illustrate
how the FPGA can radically accelerate system performance and reduce component count in a DSP application. Finally, different implementation techniques for reducing hardware requirements and increasing performance are
described in detail.
