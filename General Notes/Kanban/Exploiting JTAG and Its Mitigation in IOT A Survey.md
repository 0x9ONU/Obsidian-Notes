title: Abstract
collapse: open
Nowadays, companies are heavily investing in the development of ‚ÄúInternet of Things(IoT)‚Äù products. These companies usually and obviously hunt for lucrative business models. Currently, each person owns at least 3‚Äì4 devices (such as mobiles, personal computers, Google Assistant, Alexa, etc.) that are connected to the Internet 24/7. However, in the future, there might be hundreds of devices that will be constantly online behind each person, keeping track of body health, banking transactions, status of personal devices, etc. to make one‚Äôs life more efficient and streamlined. Thus, it is very crucial that each device should be highly secure since one‚Äôs life will become dependent on these devices. However, the current security of IoT devices is mainly focused on resiliency of device. In addition, less complex node devices are easily accessible to the public resulting in higher vulnerability. JTAG is an IEEE standard that has been defined to test proper mounting of components on PCBs (printed circuit boards) and has been extensively used by PCB manufacturers to date. This JTAG interface can be used as a backdoor entry to access and exploit devices, also defined as a physical attack. This attack can be used to make products malfunction, modify data, or, in the worst case, stop working. This paper reviews previous successful JTAG exploitations of well-known devices operating online and also reviews some proposed possible solutions to see how they can affect IoT products in a broader sense.

## Summary

### **I. Introduction**

- The **Internet of Things (IoT)** is projected to include billions of low-cost, battery-operated, always-connected devices.
    
- These devices are often physically accessible, making them vulnerable to **physical attacks**.
    
- One major vector is the **JTAG interface** (IEEE 1149.1), originally designed for chip testing and debugging.
    
- Attackers can exploit JTAG to **extract sensitive data, modify firmware**, or even **brick devices**.
    
- The paper presents **past exploitation case studies** and surveys **mitigation techniques**.

### **II. JTAG Background**

- JTAG (Joint Test Action Group) is a **debugging and boundary scan interface**.
    
- Defined by IEEE 1149.1, it provides a **Test Access Port (TAP)** with five signals: TCK, TMS, TDI, TDO, and optional TRST.
    
- TAP allows access to **Instruction Registers (IR)** and **Data Registers (DR)**, enabling manipulation of device internals.
    
- JTAG is crucial for chip validation but leaves devices vulnerable if **left exposed in production devices**.
    

---

### **III. JTAG Exploitations**

#### A. Physical Pin Modification

- Attackers can **sniff or modify signals** like TDI/TDO to steal keys or inject code.
    
- Demonstrated attacks include **hash/MAC spoofing and stream cipher attacks** on test data paths.
    

#### B. JTAGulator Tool (Figure 1)

- JTAGulator is an **open-source hardware tool** used to detect JTAG pinouts.
    
- By brute-forcing signal combinations, attackers can find TAP pins and gain access to memory/firmware.
    

#### C. Exploitation of TinyOS and Mantis OS

- Open-source OSes on sensor motes (like Mica2) were attacked using tools like **AVR-ICE** and **GDB**.
    
- Attackers extracted **SRAM**, **EEPROM**, and **Flash memory**, stealing sensitive data in <1 min.
    

#### D. Interrupt-Oriented Bugdoor Programming

- Injects malicious logic by exploiting **interrupt handlers** in microcontrollers.
    
- Demonstrated on **MSP430** with crafted interrupts that accumulate state, grow stack, and alter control flow.
    

#### E. Game Console Exploits

- The Xbox 360's **JTAG King Kong exploit** leveraged hypervisor privilege escalation via shader memory manipulation.
    
- Attackers used JTAG to hijack DMA and trigger unauthorized memory access.
    

#### F. Baseband Stack Attacks (GSM/UMTS)

- **Fake BTS (Base Transceiver Station)** sends malformed TMSI or AUTN data to phones, triggering stack overflows.
    
- JTAG was used to inspect or crash firmware in devices like HTC Dream and iPhones.
    

#### G. PLC Exploits (SCADA Systems)

- Attacks on Allen-Bradley PLCs used JTAG to:
    
    - Trigger **DoS attacks**
        
    - Bypass control modes
        
    - Dump and analyze **firmware via RealView ICE and IDA Pro**
        

#### H. Android OS Attacks

- JTAG-based **privilege escalation** in Android 6.0.1 using Lauterbach Trace32.
    
- Attackers manipulated `sys_setresuid()` to gain root access via **kernel pointer exposure**.

### **IV. JTAG Security Solutions**

#### A. Physical Unclonable Functions (PUF)

- Leverages **manufacturing variability** to generate unique hardware ‚Äúfingerprints.‚Äù
    
- PUF-based authentication (e.g., **Ring Oscillators**) ensures only trusted debuggers can activate JTAG.
    

#### B. Public Key Cryptography (ECC)

- Uses **Elliptic Curve Cryptography** and **Schnorr protocol** to secure JTAG access.
    
- Supports **offline and online modes**, with **minimal performance overhead** post-authentication (see **Figure 2**).
    

#### C. Challenge-Response System

- Implements **TRNG and SHA-256** based on-chip challenge generation.
    
- Host must compute correct response before enabling access (see **Figure 3**).
    

#### D. Security Level Architecture

- Implements **multi-level privilege access** using AES keys:
    
    - p1: Full access (development)
        
    - p4: Complete lockdown (deployment)
        
- Figure 4 shows the **secure architecture block diagram**.
    

#### E. Credential-Based Approach

- End-to-end verification system using a central server to assign user credentials.
    
- Involves **two-phase authentication** (server and user-side hash/XOR checks).
    

#### F. Statistical Machine Learning (SLIC-J)

- Learns access patterns to identify suspicious JTAG usage.
    
- Achieved **94% accuracy** in detecting illegitimate access using **OpenSPARC T2** and **decision trees**.
    

#### G. JoKER (Rootkit Detection via JTAG)

- Used JTAG to extract **kernel data** and detect **rootkits in Android devices**.
    
- Compares runtime memory with clean images to find hidden processes.

### **V. Discussion**

- Most IoT devices are **low-cost, battery-powered**, making **hardware-intensive** protections impractical.
    
- **Software solutions or server-side authentication** (SSL/TLS) might be more viable.
    
- **Machine learning protections** depend on quality datasets and may introduce **latency and overhead**.
    
- **Balanced security design** is essential‚Äîespecially for field-updatable devices.
    

---

### **VI. Conclusions**

- JTAG remains a **critical vulnerability** if left unprotected in production hardware.
    
- The survey presents:
    
    - Real-world attacks on consumer (XBOX, Android), industrial (PLC), and embedded (sensor node) systems.
        
    - Mitigations using cryptography, machine learning, physical isolation, and access control.
        
- Industry-wide collaboration is needed to **update the IEEE 1149.1 standard** or form a new one tailored to **IoT security**.
