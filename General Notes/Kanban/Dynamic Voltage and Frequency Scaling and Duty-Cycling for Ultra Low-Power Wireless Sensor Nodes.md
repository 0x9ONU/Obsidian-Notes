Energy efficiency presents a significant challenge to the reliability of Internet of Things (IoT) services. Wireless Sensor Networks (WSNs) present as an elementary technology of IoT, which has limited resources. Appropriate energy management techniques can perform increasing energy efficiency under variable workload conditions. Therefore, this paper aims to experimentally implement a hybrid energy management solution, combining Dynamic Voltage and Frequency Scaling (DVFS) and Duty-Cycling. The DVFS technique is implemented as an effective power management scheme to optimize the operating conditions during data processing. Moreover, the duty-cycling method is applied to reduce the energy consumption of the transceiver. Hardware optimization is performed by selecting the low-power microcontroller, MSP430, using experimental estimation and characterization. Another contribution is evaluating the energy-saving design by defining the normalized power as a metric to measure the consumed power of the proposed model per throughput. Extensive simulations and real-world implementations indicate that normalized power can be significantly reduced while sustaining performance levels in high-data IoT use cases.
