The semiconductor industry plays an ever-increasing role in society, providing microelectronic components called chips that are used in a wide variety of electronic applications. The rapid increase of the production of chips is responsible for considerable effects on the environment during the different phases of their life cycle. In spite of increasing pressure from stakeholders to control these effects, no international standard or agreement has yet been established. In this context, the paper proposes a set of environmental indicators that take into account the most serious damages induced by these products.
To establish an exhaustive list of indicators, the specificities of the semiconductor branch are first analysed in literature, identifying pressures on the sector coming from the downstream chain – chip buyers and users – and finally by analysing data from industrial case studies. In order to highlight the most significant direct and indirect impacts, each aspect of the chips' life cycle phases is studied independently. The indicators reflect the particularities of the industry and point out the major impact categories. They can be therefore be used for standardized environmental analysis of microelectronic products. The paper retains seven environmental indicators: resource depletion, eutrophication, water stress, toxicity, summer smog and local electrical consumption. The final set of indicators will help draw the environmental profile of the microelectronic chips over the full life cycle of the products. It is a step towards necessary standardization in the microelectronic industry. The indicators are consistent with current state of the art and can evolve as progress is made on the definition and calculation of new indicators.

## Summary

### **I. Introduction**

- Semiconductor chips are essential to modern electronics but cause **significant environmental impacts** across their life cycle:
    
    - Pollution from manufacturing
        
    - High energy and material use
        
    - E-waste accumulation
        
- Despite regulatory pressure, there is **no international standard** for evaluating chip-level environmental impact.
    
- This paper proposes **seven key indicators** for building a standardized environmental profile of chips using **Life Cycle Assessment (LCA)** methodology.

### **II. State-of-the-Art of Environmental Knowledge in the Microelectronic Sector**

#### Semiconductor Life Cycle Overview

- Chips are made via **front-end (wafer processing)** and **back-end (packaging)** stages.
    
- Environmental impact occurs not just during manufacturing, but also from:
    
    - Raw material extraction
        
    - Electricity use during operation
        
    - E-waste at end-of-life
        
- **Figures 1 & 2** illustrate life cycle stages and environmental input-output flows.
    

#### Scientific and Industry Reviews

- Few detailed LCA studies exist; chip-level environmental data is limited and often outdated.
    
- **Table 1a** (front/back-end) and **Table 1b** (design centers) show expert rankings of environmental concerns:
    
    - High concerns: water toxicity, global warming, resource depletion, water stress
        
    - Moderate concerns: acidification, eutrophication, VOCs, human health
        
    - Low concerns: noise, smell, ozone depletion
        

#### Role of Rare Earth Elements (REEs)

- Though minor in volume, REEs like cerium, praseodymium, and samarium are used in polishing and MRAMs.
    
- REE production is **resource-intensive**, with high water and energy use.
    
- Future chip technologies may increase REE reliance.

### **III. Environmental Impacts of Microelectronic Components**

#### Repartition of Impacts by Life Cycle Stage

- A 2009 LCA study (Villard) across four chip applications showed:
    
    - **Global warming impact** split between manufacturing and use.
        
    - End-of-life and transport have **minimal contributions (<0.1%)**.
        
- **Figure 3** and **Table 3** show distribution of impacts (e.g., 85–95% of toxicity arises in manufacturing).
    

#### Manufacturing Phase (Top-Down and Bottom-Up Approaches)

- Front-end processes involve **chemicals, ultrapure water, electricity, and toxic emissions**.
    
- **Tables 4a & 4b** provide typical input/output inventories:
    
    - Front-end: 25g chemicals, 1000 Wh electricity, 10g waste
        
    - Back-end: 2g resin, 200 Wh electricity, 5g waste
        
- **Tables 5a & 5b** list environmental effects like VOCs, acids, metals, and toxic gases.
    

#### Supply Chain (Upstream)

- Environmental burdens from electricity, metals, ultrapure water, PFCs, and chemicals.
    
- **Tables 6 & 7** categorize key resource types and their environmental impacts.
    

#### Use and Downstream Phases

- Main impacts are from **electricity use during application** (global warming).
    
- Disposal has negligible impact unless rare metals are involved.
    
- **Table 8** summarizes downstream impacts (minimal except power consumption).

### **IV. Environmental Hotspots**

#### Key Environmental Categories (Table 9)

1. **Global warming** – From electricity and PFCs
    
2. **Resource depletion** – From rare metals and gases
    
3. **Water stress** – From ultrapure water use
    
4. **Summer smog** – VOCs from solvents, chemicals
    
5. **Eutrophication** – From phosphorous/nitrogen compounds
    
6. **Toxicity** – From metals, acids, and solvents
    

#### Waste and Acidification

- While present, **waste and acidification** are considered **redundant** or covered by other indicators (e.g., toxicity, eutrophication).
    

---

### **V. Considerations for Suitable Indicators**

#### Recommended Metrics:

1. **Global Warming** – Track CO₂ and PFC emissions
    
2. **Abiotic Resource Depletion** – Include rare/precious metals and gases
    
3. **Water Eutrophication** – Reflect chemical impacts on ecosystems
    
4. **Imported Raw Water Volume** – Proxy for **water stress**
    
5. **Human Eco-Toxicity** – Reflects risk from substances in air/water
    
6. **Summer Smog** – Tracks photochemical air pollution from VOCs
    
7. **Local Electrical Consumption (in MJ)** – Avoids distortion from local energy mix
    

> ⚠️ These indicators align with international standards (e.g., ISO 14031) and existing LCA software (TRACI, CML, USEtox).

### **VI. Conclusions**

- The paper proposes a **seven-indicator framework** tailored to the chip life cycle:

|**Indicator**|**Justification**|
|---|---|
|Global warming|Major impact from PFCs and electricity use|
|Abiotic depletion|Semiconductor production uses rare gases and metals|
|Water eutrophication|Ultrapure water and acids degrade aquatic ecosystems|
|Imported raw water|Ultrapure water is a stressor in arid regions|
|Human eco-toxicity|RoHS-regulated materials and solvents pose health/ecosystem risks|
|Summer smog|VOCs from chemicals and energy-intensive processes impact air quality|
|Local electrical use (MJ)|Reflects true energy intensity regardless of grid energy mix|
- These indicators:
    
    - Enable **standardized environmental profiling**
        
    - Support **eco-design**
        
    - Help **prioritize sustainability efforts**
        
- The authors advocate for a future **international standard** that includes these indicators and aligns with broader LCA methodologies.
