```ad-summary

- Suggest two power-saving techniques that can be implemented on the SBC. Consider aspects like clock gating, dynamic voltage scaling, or sleep modes. How can these techniques help reduce overall power consumption without compromising essential performance?
- How does the choice of processor (ARM Cortex-A9) and FPGA impact the silicon area of the chip?
- Suggest a specific fabrication process/technology (e.g., 28nm, 14nm, etc.) for the chip. Provide reasons for your choice in terms of cost, performance, availability, and how it impacts silicon area (and ultimately chip price).
- How would these fabrication choices affect production cost and availability of the components?
- How do the speed requirements (e.g., for I/O processing) impact your choice of processor and FPGA? Are there any areas where you can optimize time (e.g., through clock gating, frequency scaling, pipeline stages)?
