collapse: open
The Zynq®-7000 family is based on the Xilinx SoC architecture. These products integrate a feature-rich dual-core or single-core ARM®
Cortex™-A9 based processing system (PS) and 28 nm Xilinx programmable logic (PL) in a single device. The ARM Cortex-A9 CPUs are
the heart of the PS and also include on-chip memory, external memory interfaces, and a rich set of peripheral connectivity interfaces.
