**In-Depth Analysis of an Active CMOS Power Reduction Technique**

# Objective:

Individually research and write a short report analyzing one active technique used to reduce either switching or leakage power in CMOS design. Your report should explain how the technique works, when and why it's used, and its trade-offs in terms of area, performance, and complexity. Include a real-world application or example where the technique is implemented.

# Report Structure:

## Introduction:

    Briefly describe CMOS power concerns (switching vs. leakage).
    State the chosen technique and its purpose.

## How It Works

    Explain the mechanism of the technique clearly (include a diagram if helpful).
    Describe what type of power it reduces and how.

## Design Trade-offs

    Discuss impacts on area, performance, complexity, and ease of integration.

## Real-World Use Case

    Identify a processor, SoC, or circuit where the technique is used.
    Include a brief explanation of how it's applied in that context.
