While the flexibility and performance of a programmable SBC make it ideal for modern applications, its programmable nature also introduces several security and reliability challenges that must be addressed before deployment. One of the first and most dangerous vulnerabilities lies in the use of the JTAG port. While intended for debugging and post-fabrication testing, the JTAG interface can be exploited by malicious actors to gain full read/write access to memory, bypass software authentication layers, or inject malicious firmware [38]. Given that this SBC includes a JTAG port for validation, it must be locked down after testing is complete. A simple fix is the use of JTAG disabling mechanisms such as fuses or locking bitstreams that remove access to the debug interface once the board is ready for field use. Additionally, placing the JTAG interface behind a physical access control barrier or requiring cryptographic authentication before activation can further reduce risk [38].

Another critical vulnerability lies in the bitstream of the FPGA itself. As an inherently reprogrammable device, the FPGA is vulnerable to bitstream sniffing, tampering, or replay attacks if unprotected. Since the FPGA will serve as the accelerator backbone for both the TPU and DSP, protecting its functionality is essential. One common method of securing this is through the use of bitstream encryption and authentication schemes built into the FPGA toolchain [39]. Enabling authenticated bitstreams ensures that only signed, validated configurations are loaded onto the device and can prevent the board from operating if tampering is detected. While these methods add minimal cost or complexity to the manufacturing pipeline, they drastically reduce the potential for cyberattacks that exploit programmable logic.

In terms of long-term reliability, the primary consideration lies in maintaining fault-tolerance of the FPGA under continuous operation and ensuring that system degradation does not introduce silent errors. Advanced SoCs like the Zynq-7000 have shown susceptibility to Single Event Upsets (SEUs), thermal cycling degradation, and internal configuration bit failures when exposed to long-term or high-stress environments [40]. One solution to mitigate this issue is partial reconfiguration combined with configuration memory scrubbing. This technique allows the FPGA to continuously monitor and reload corrupted logic blocks during idle cycles without impacting live operation. Furthermore, wear-leveling memory allocation and power-aware task scheduling from the CPU can extend the life of both volatile and non-volatile memory blocks, which is crucial in embedded systems running 24/7 in harsh conditions such as automotive environments.

Another major aspect in achieving long-term reliability comes from the upstream supply chain. As counterfeit components continue to proliferate within the global ICT infrastructure, ensuring that all chips—especially critical ones like the TPU, DSP, and FPGA—come from verified distributors is vital [41]. If counterfeit components are integrated into the board, they may pass basic electrical tests but fail prematurely due to poor thermal characteristics, lower quality silicon, or improperly fabricated internal connections. Especially since the board focuses on automobile applications, a fault here could be devastating. To prevent this, the final manufacturing pipeline must source components only from traceable, high-reliability vendors who provide lot tracking and authentication. Additionally, implementing board-level authenticity checks such as IC serial validation or electrical fingerprinting during quality control can further reduce risk. These minor additions can protect the long-term function of the SBC while keeping the cost per unit low in mass production.

By integrating these security and reliability strategies—JTAG protection, secure bitstream handling, FPGA error correction, and counterfeit prevention—the programmable SBC can maintain long-term operation in a wide variety of applications without compromising integrity or durability.
