The ZedBoard is an evaluation and development board based on the Xilinx Zynq-7000 Extensible
Processing Platform. Combining a dual Corex-A9 Processing System (PS) with 85,000 Series-7
Programmable Logic (PL) cells, the Zynq-7000 EPP can be targeted for broad use in many
applications. The ZedBoardâ€™s robust mix of on-board peripherals and expansion capabilities
make it an ideal platform for both novice and experienced designers
