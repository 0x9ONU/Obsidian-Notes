title: Abstract
collapse: open
On the one hand, accelerating convolution neural networks (CNNs) on FPGAs requires ever increasing high energy effi- ciency in the edge computing paradigm. On the other hand, unlike normal digital algorithms, CNNs maintain their high robust- ness even with limited timing errors. By taking advantage of this unique feature, we propose to use dynamic voltage and fre- quency scaling (DVFS) to further optimize the energy efficiency for CNNs. First, we have developed a DVFS framework on FP- GAs. Second, we apply the DVFS to SkyNet, a state-of-the-art neural network targeting on object detection. Third, we analyze the impact of DVFS on CNNs in terms of performance, power, energy efficiency and accuracy. Compared to the state-of-the-art, experimental results show that we have achieved 38% improvement in energy efficiency without any loss in accuracy. Results also show that we can achieve 47% improvement in energy efficiency if we allow 0.11% relaxation in accuracy
