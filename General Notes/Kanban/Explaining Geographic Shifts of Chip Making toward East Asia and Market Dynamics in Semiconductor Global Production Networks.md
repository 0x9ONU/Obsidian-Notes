Few recent geographic studies have focused on how market dynamics might explain macroregional shifts in industrial production. This article examines the pivoting of semiconductor manufacturing toward East Asia during the 2010s, drawing upon proprietary data sets and interviews with leading semiconductor firms. Building on the existing conceptions of user-producer collaborations in economic geography, I conceptualize the relevance of market dynamics for explaining industrial-geographic change. In particular, I specify how customer intimacy in intermediate markets and demand responsiveness in end markets, as two critical dimensions of market dynamics, create strong demand for new chip-making capacity, and how spatial and relational proximity can strengthen interfirm collaboration and customer intimacy in semiconductor production networks. Empirically, market dynamics prompting massive growth in East Asian chip-making capacity are manifested in new product transition and chip demand from global lead firms in the information and communications technology sector and their manufacturing partners mostly located in East Asia. Demand responsiveness to new lead firms and end markets within East Asia has also induced chip design and new capacity to be colocated in the region. Customer intimacy between chip design firms and their foundry providers has led to massive growth of outsourced wafer fabrication in East Asia. Complementing supply-side explanations, such as state support and technological leveraging, this article’s core findings on demand-led market dynamics in explaining geographic shifts in semiconductor manufacturing contribute not only to the studies of global production networks in high-tech industries but also to the renewed interest among geographers in market dynamics and their consequences for uneven development.

## Summary

### **1. Introduction**

Semiconductor manufacturing has pivoted sharply toward East Asia, beyond Japan, since the 2000s. While Japan once held nearly half of the world’s fabrication capacity in 2000, by 2018, **Taiwan and South Korea led globally**, with East Asia accounting for **over 80% of global IC fabrication**.

This transition coincided with a surge in chip demand from **ICT sectors**, making end-market **demand responsiveness** a vital driver. The paper proposes that **market dynamics**, rather than just **state policy or cost advantages**, must be considered to explain this shift.

### **2. Explaining Global Shifts in Chip Making**

#### **2.1 Demand-Led Market Dynamics**

Two core pathways explain the East Asian shift:

1. **Rising OEM customers** in smartphones, tablets, and PCs centered in Asia.
    
2. **Customer intimacy** that fosters faster response times and customized chip production.
    

This market-driven dynamic complements existing supply-side factors like state policy and technological capabilities.

### **3. Chips and Fabs: Explaining Global Shifts in Semiconductor Manufacturing during the 2010s**

#### **3.1 Capacity Expansion Data**

- **Total global fabs:** ~325 in 2000, peaking at 344 in 2010, then consolidating to 296 in 2018.
    
- **Total wafer output:** ~17 million wafers/month in 2018 (2× growth since 2000).
    
- **Top producers in 2018:**
    
    - Taiwan: 4M wafers/month
        
    - South Korea: 3.6M
        
    - Japan: 3M
        
    - China: 2.2M
        
    - US: 1.8M
#### **3.2 Figure of Interest – Figure 1**

**Figure 1** outlines **market dynamics** in semiconductor production networks, highlighting:

- IDM firms like **Intel** and **Samsung**
    
- Foundries like **TSMC**
    
- Fabless firms like **Qualcomm** and **Apple**
    
- OEMs and final assembly operations
    

It captures the vertical structure and flow from chip design to fabrication and end products

### **4. Market Dynamics in Semiconductor Production Networks**

#### **4.1 Customer Intimacy**

- Fabless firms (e.g., Apple, AMD, Qualcomm) need tight coordination with foundries like TSMC for custom process technologies.
    
- Foundries require **committed orders** to justify capital-intensive expansion.
    

#### **4.2 Demand Responsiveness**

- New end markets like smartphones and data centers require **rapid chip turnaround**.
    
- Leading fabless firms collocate R&D centers in Asia to **align with East Asian OEMs**

### **5. Firm-Level Evidence of Market Dynamics**

#### **Table 6 Insights**

- All top fabless firms—**Broadcom, Qualcomm, Nvidia, MediaTek, HiSilicon, and Apple**—rely on **East Asian foundries** for wafer fabrication.
    
- TSMC, Samsung Foundry, and GlobalFoundries dominate as fabrication partners.
    

For instance, TSMC in 2018:

- Fabricated **2.3M wafers/month**
    
- Allocated:
    
    - 24% to Apple
        
    - 15% to HiSilicon
        
    - 6% to Qualcomm

### **6. Conclusion**

The shift in semiconductor manufacturing toward East Asia is best explained by **market dynamics**:

- **Customer intimacy** in design and fabrication partnerships
    
- **Demand responsiveness** to rapidly evolving ICT markets
    

This explains why chip production capacity grew in Taiwan and South Korea even **after state policies weakened**, suggesting that **strategic firm-level coordination** with global production networks (GPNs) now plays a stronger role.
