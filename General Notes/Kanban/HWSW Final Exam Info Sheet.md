**Scenario:** Designing a Cost-Effective Programmable Single-Board Computer (SBC)

You are hired as a consultant to help design a cost-effective, programmable single-board computer (SBC) based on the ZedBoard, featuring an ARM Cortex-A9 processor and FPGA. Your task is to analyze the current design, identify essential features, and propose a simplified version of the board that remains user-friendly, cost-effective, and programmable for embedded applications.

**Overview of the ZedBoard**

The ZedBoard combines an ARM Cortex-A9 processor with an FPGA. This allows you to run Linux and develop custom hardware acceleration for real-time tasks.

Key features:

- ARM Cortex-A9 processor
- FPGA for hardware acceleration
- 1 GB DDR3 SDRAM
- Connectivity options: Gigabit Ethernet, USB 2.0, HDMI, audio
- I/O expansion connectors

**Your Task**

Prepare a report that responds to the following and cite all your references:

1. Target Applications

First, suggest three target applications for the SBC. For each application, explain:

- The key features of the SBC that make it suitable for the target application.
- The performance and I/O requirements needed for the application.
- Consider how the board size and component density may impact the application. For example, would the board need to be compact for integration into a smaller device?

2. Minimum Feature Set

Based on your suggested applications, what core features should be included on the board to make it functional but cost-effective? Focus on essential I/O, memory, and processing capabilities. How do these features impact the cost of production? Consider:

- How might simplifying the board (e.g., reducing inessential I/O or connectors) reduce overall manufacturing costs?
- Should the board size be optimized for compactness or scalability for different applications?

3. Simplifying the Design

How can you simplify the board’s design while maintaining performance? Propose two ways to reduce cost and complexity (e.g., reducing I/O, moving some tasks to FPGA, or using software-based solutions).

Also, should the board be manufactured in-house or outsourced?

- If you suggest outsourcing, how do you ensure the supply chain remains reliable and cost-effective (considering issues such as tariffs, availability of components, and shipping costs)?
- If in-house manufacturing is preferred, how would you manage production to reduce costs, especially when considering board size and the associated costs of different fabrication processes?

4. VLSI Considerations: Power, Area, and Time Tradeoffs

- Suggest two power-saving techniques that can be implemented on the SBC. Consider aspects like clock gating, dynamic voltage scaling, or sleep modes. How can these techniques help reduce overall power consumption without compromising essential performance?
- How does the choice of processor (ARM Cortex-A9) and FPGA impact the silicon area of the chip?
- Suggest a specific fabrication process/technology (e.g., 28nm, 14nm, etc.) for the chip. Provide reasons for your choice in terms of cost, performance, availability, and how it impacts silicon area (and ultimately chip price).
- How would these fabrication choices affect production cost and availability of the components?
- How do the speed requirements (e.g., for I/O processing) impact your choice of processor and FPGA? Are there any areas where you can optimize time (e.g., through clock gating, frequency scaling, pipeline stages)?

5. Health, Safety, and Environmental

- Health/Safety: Are there any potential health or safety risks? How can these be minimized?
- Environmental: How can you make sure the board is environmentally friendly (e.g., energy efficiency, recyclable materials)? Consider any potential challenges in sourcing environmentally-friendly components globally.

6. Global Considerations

- How would you design the board to be suitable for global distribution? Consider part availability, cost of shipping, and scalability.
- Electronic supply chain: What challenges might arise from the global electronic supply chain? How might you mitigate risks such as component shortages, supply delays, or tariff increases?

7. User-Friendliness

- How can you make the board easier to use for developers, especially those unfamiliar with FPGA? Consider simplifying the development environment, providing accessible CAD tools maybe better than Vivado and Vitis, or improving documentation and adding tutorials.
- Also, how might the board’s size and connector types affect the ease of use for developers or integrators?

8. Security and Reliability

Identify two security risks for a programmable SBC and propose simple solutions. Also, how would you ensure the board is reliable for long-term use in various applications? Consider the impact of supply chain on ensuring high-quality, durable components for reliability.

9. Questions to Clarify the Design

Formulate three important questions you would ask the investor to clarify aspects of the design. Explain why these questions matter and how the answers will impact your design choices.

10. Final Recommendation

Summarize your design choices, highlighting the key features and how your simplifications address cost, performance, global considerations, and supply chain management. Include a basic diagram or table of the recommended board architecture.
