- How can you make the board easier to use for developers, especially those unfamiliar with FPGA? Consider simplifying the development environment, providing accessible CAD tools maybe better than Vivado and Vitis, or improving documentation and adding tutorials.
- Also, how might the board’s size and connector types affect the ease of use for developers or integrators?

One of the most overlooked aspects of hardware design is the ease of use for developers, especially those who are not familiar with FPGA workflows. While tools like Vivado and Vitis are widely used in the Xilinx ecosystem, they often present a steep learning curve, particularly for newcomers or software-focused developers. To ease this burden and make the board more developer-friendly, alternative design suites such as _Libero IDE_ [36] and _Quartus Prime_ [37] can be evaluated for inspiration or compatibility, depending on licensing and device support. Libero IDE, developed by Microchip, is known for its streamlined project setup, integration with soft-core processors, and intuitive debug tools that simplify the onboarding process for entry-level users [36]. Similarly, Intel’s Quartus Prime software supports rapid prototyping with platform designer tools and schematic-based design entry, which may feel more familiar to those coming from microcontroller or embedded design backgrounds [37]. While the board will still center around the Zynq-7000 and require Vivado for synthesis, a compatibility layer or high-level wrapper interface could abstract Vivado’s complexity and export RTL modules directly to pre-built templates [3]. Moreover, a well-documented tutorial suite modeled after these friendlier IDEs should accompany the board, offering both text and video walkthroughs for everything from GPIO control to integrating the TPU and DSP accelerators.

Beyond tooling, the physical form factor and connectors of the board greatly influence its usability for both developers and systems integrators. A smaller board footprint improves portability and deployment in edge environments, but it must be balanced with the need for accessible I/O. Rather than using niche or fragile connectors, standard headers like GPIO, USB-C, and HDMI are prioritized to ensure compatibility with off-the-shelf cables and breakout boards. The elimination of bulky legacy connectors such as VGA and FMC reduces the board area without compromising functionality, aligning with the earlier cost-cutting decisions. Furthermore, developers should not be forced to fabricate custom interposers or learn exotic pin layouts—key interfaces must be clearly labeled and documented in reference guides, ideally with downloadable CAD files and pre-written HDL examples. The included JTAG pad also allows for the easy of debugging and development by allowing anyone to have access to all the registers within the device. By lowering both the software and hardware barrier to entry, the board becomes a powerful embedded tool that can be used by anyone.
