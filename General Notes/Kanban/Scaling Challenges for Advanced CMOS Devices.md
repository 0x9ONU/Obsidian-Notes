title: Abstract
collapse: open
The economic health of the semiconductor industry requires substantial scaling of chip power,
performance, and area with every new technology node that is ramped into manufacturing in two year
intervals. With no direct physical link to any particular design dimensions, industry wide the
technology node names are chosen to reflect the roughly 70% scaling of linear dimensions necessary
to enable the doubling of transistor density predicted by Moore‚Äôs law and typically progress as 22nm,
14nm, 10nm, 7nm, 5nm, 3nm etc. At the time of this writing, the most advanced technology node in
volume manufacturing is the 14nm node with the 7nm node in advanced development and 5nm in
early exploration. The technology challenges to reach thus far have not been trivial. This review
addresses the past innovation in response to the device challenges and discusses in-depth the
integration challenges associated with the sub-22nm non-planar finFET technologies that are either in
advanced technology development or in manufacturing. It discusses the integration challenges in
patterning for both the front-end-of-line and back-end-of-line elements in the CMOS transistor. In
addition, this article also gives a brief review of integrating an alternate channel material into the
finFET technology, as well as next generation device architectures such as nanowire and vertical FETs.
Lastly, it also discusses challenges dictated by the need to interconnect the ever-increasing density of
transistors.

    - **Back-End-of-Line (BEOL)**: Interconnect
        
    - **Patterning**: Lithography and design rules

### **2. Challenges and Approaches for CMOS Transistor Scaling**

#### **2.1 Channel and Gate Engineering**

- Key metric: Gate must **electrostatically control the channel** even when off.
    
- Early techniques:
    
    - **Shallow source/drain extensions**
        
    - **Halo doping** to control leakage
        
- Transitioned from bulk silicon to **SOI (Silicon-On-Insulator)**:
    
    - **PDSOI** (partially depleted)
        
    - **FDSOI** (fully depleted) improves control and allows back-biasing.

- **Fig. 3**: Comparison between Bulk, PDSOI, and FDSOI devices.
    
- **finFET** (tri-gate) emerged after planar scaling hit limits.
    
    - **Electrostatic control** on three sides improves ON/OFF current ratios.
        
    - Scaling challenges appear <7nm ‚Üí transition to **gate-all-around (GAA)** devices (e.g., stacked nanowires, vertical FETs).
        

##### üîç _Figure 5_:

- Shows architecture progression: finFET ‚Üí nanowire ‚Üí vertical FET.
    
- Gate materials evolution:
    
    - **High-k/Metal Gate (HKMG)** replaced poly gates (45nm node) to address leakage and poly depletion.
        
    - **Replacement Metal Gate (RMG)** allows thermal processing before inserting the final gate.
        
    - Next-gen: **Negative Capacitance FETs (NCFETs)** for steeper subthreshold slope.
        
- **Stress engineering** improves mobility:
    
    - Tensile for electrons (NMOS), compressive for holes (PMOS)
        
    - **Channel orientation** (e.g., (111) silicon) and **material substitution** (e.g., SiGe, InGaAs, MoS‚ÇÇ) also affect mobility.

$$R=\frac{k_1 \lambda}{NA}$$‚Äã
    
Where $k_1$‚Äã is a process factor.
    
- Resolution improvements slowed with 193nm lithography.

- Co-optimization across all levels (FEOL, BEOL, patterning, layout) is essential for 5nm and beyond.
