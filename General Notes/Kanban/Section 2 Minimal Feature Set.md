Based on your suggested applications, what core features should be included on the board to make it functional but cost-effective? Focus on essential I/O, memory, and processing capabilities. How do these features impact the cost of production? Consider:

- How might simplifying the board (e.g., reducing inessential I/O or connectors) reduce overall manufacturing costs?
- Should the board size be optimized for compactness or scalability for different applications?
