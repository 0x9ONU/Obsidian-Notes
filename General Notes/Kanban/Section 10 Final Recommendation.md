The final SBC design centers around the Zynq-7000 SoC, combining an ARM Cortex-A9 processor with FPGA fabric to create a flexible, reprogrammable platform suitable for signal processing, AI inference, and embedded control. To enhance its capabilities, the Coral TPU and TI Sitara DSP were added for low-power AI acceleration and analog processing, respectively. However, to offset their performance limits, the FPGA is used as a dynamic co-acceleratorâ€”extending MAC operations, creating custom DSP logic, and sharing memory bandwidth when needed. This hybrid approach ensures maximum compute efficiency across all workloads.

To reduce cost and complexity, non-essential components such as VGA, audio jacks, debug switches, and mezzanine expansions were removed, resulting in a board that's $61.96 cheaper per unit without sacrificing core functionality. The retained interfaces, including USB, HDMI, JTAG, XADC, and DDR3 RAM, were selected for essential I/O, user interaction, and analog input. The board targets a minimized footprint for embedded deployment and leverages a 28nm process node shared across all major chips to avoid process mismatch and reduce fabrication overhead.

Security and reliability are addressed through locked-down JTAG, encrypted bitstreams, fault-tolerant FPGA reconfiguration, and supply chain safeguards against counterfeit components. Combined with user-friendly documentation, standard connectors, and an accessible FPGA development flow, the board is designed to be cost-effective, secure, globally manufacturable, and developer-ready for automotive, IoT, and AI edge applications.
