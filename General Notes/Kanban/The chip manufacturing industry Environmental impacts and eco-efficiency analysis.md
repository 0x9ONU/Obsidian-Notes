collapse: open
Semiconductor manufacturing has followed the fate of a large part of industrial production: many companies, around the world, have maintained higher functions (design and engineering) and outsourced other production stages to third-party manufacturers, located mostly in Asia. Some chip companies have thus become “fabless” firms, commissioning the “fabrication” of their product to wafer “foundries” or “fabs”. For the first time, in this paper, by calculating and subsequently analyzing various key environmental performance indicators (KEPIs) from the data of the fabs Corporate Social Responsibility (CSR) reports, the environmental impacts and the eco-efficiency of the world's leading semiconductor foundries are analyzed and assessed. The aim is to highlight the relations between company size, technological capacity and environmental impact. A preliminary homogenization was necessary to process the company original data and indicators, often related to different units of production, and to obtain raw data in absolute value. Subsequently, adopting a single common manufacturing index (MI), it was possible to obtain and use new comparable performance indicators and KEPIs. The consequent comparative assessment allowed to give a reliable overall picture of the current resource consumption and pollution of this highly strategic sector, highlighting its next heavy environmental challenges. The result, in fact, is that, differently to what happens in many other sectors, in the semiconductor industry, larger company size (higher revenue), higher value added per wafer produced (higher revenue/MI), and higher technological capacity (higher R&D expenses and smaller technology node) are not always related to lower quantities (per unit of production) of water, energy, waste, wastewater and GHG emissions. It is hoped that, for the future, foundry firms, especially those with the most advanced technologies, will invest much more to optimize their resource use and to further reduce GHGs emissions and waste generation.

## Summary

### **I. Introduction**

- Chips (ICs) are the core of the digital economy and national security, used in everything from phones to defense systems.
    
- The chip industry reached **$550B** revenue in 2021, with wafer fabrication alone contributing over **$107B**.
    
- Manufacturing is divided into:
    
    1. Design (often fabless)
        
    2. Fabrication (done by foundries)
        
    3. Assembly, testing, and packaging (ATP)
        
- Foundries like **TSMC**, **Samsung**, **UMC**, **GF**, **SMIC**, **HHS**, and **PSMC** dominate wafer fabrication.
    
- This study is the **first to comprehensively assess the environmental performance** of major foundries using CSR (Corporate Social Responsibility) data.

### **II. Materials and Methods**

#### Scope of Study:

- Focused only on **foundries** (not IDMs or ATP firms) to maintain consistency.
    
- Environmental metrics were extracted from CSR reports, focusing on **standardized Key Environmental Performance Indicators (KEPIs)**.
    

#### Research Framework:

Outlined in **Table 1**, the analysis followed 5 phases:

1. Data Collection from CSR reports.
    
2. **Manufacturing Index (MI)** creation to standardize output.
    
3. Data Homogenization using MI.
    
4. KEPI calculation: energy, water, waste, GHGs per MI.
    
5. Comparative Analysis using a qualitative **“mood scale”** from Very Good to Very Bad.

### **III. Results**

#### Company Performance Metrics (Table 4):

Standardized to a **common MI (wfr-m²)**, allowing direct comparisons.

|Indicator|TSMC|UMC|GF|SMIC|PSMC|HHS|
|---|---|---|---|---|---|---|
|Revenue/MI ($/m²)|48,970|26,510|30,622|34,350|6,936|13,255|
|GHG Emissions (Scope 1+2)/MI|10,558 kg|11,431 kg|3,280 kg|17,186 kg|5,485 kg|6,988 kg|
|Energy Use/MI (MWh)|18.02|16.73|16.52|14.33|10.32|12.95|
|Water Use/MI (tons)|137.5|101.2|140.1|214.9|49.8|248.3|
|Hazardous Waste/MI (kg)|318|141|213|232|51|144|

#### Key Observations:

- **TSMC and SMIC** have the **highest technological capacity**, but also **highest environmental burdens** per unit.
    
- **F-GHG emissions** (fluorinated gases with high GWP) were highest in **PSMC and HHS**, indicating less gas recovery capability.
    
- **Wastewater discharge and hazardous waste** also correlated with higher technology complexity.
    

#### Figures of Interest:

- **Figure 1** – Revenue per Unit of Production (TSMC leads)
    
- **Figure 2** – Total GHG Intensity: SMIC is highest
    
- **Figure 3** – F-GHG Emissions: PSMC, HHS highest
    
- **Figure 4** – Energy Intensity: TSMC highest
    
- **Figure 5** – Water Withdrawal: HHS highest
    
- **Figure 6** – Wastewater Discharge: GF highest
    
- **Figure 7** – General Waste per MI: TSMC highest
    
- **Figure 8** – Hazardous Waste per MI: TSMC highest
    

#### Summary Dashboard (Table 5):

- **SMIC (0.89)** and **TSMC (0.70)** had the **highest average environmental impact**.
    
- **PSMC (0.38)** had the best eco-efficiency.
    
- Efficiency did **not correlate directly** with advanced technology or revenue.

### **IV. Discussion**

- Past studies (Ahmad, Boyd, Wang, Kuo) confirm that **cleanroom energy use** and **lithography/etching** processes are major impact sources.
    
- Complexity of technology node (e.g., 5 nm vs. 22 nm) significantly affects environmental footprint.
    
- The use of **non-renewable energy** and **fluorinated gases** adds a “double burden” of emissions and resource depletion.

### **V. Conclusions**

- **Bigger and more advanced chip manufacturers** do not necessarily have **better eco-efficiency**.
    
- Semiconductor fabrication is highly resource- and energy-intensive, especially at smaller nodes.
    
- There is an urgent need for:
    
    - **More efficient cleanroom energy systems**
        
    - **F-GHG recovery technologies**
        
    - **Eco-design of chip production lines**
        
- The paper provides a baseline framework for comparing environmental performance across foundries using a **normalized MI-based KEPI method**.
