How can you simplify the boardâ€™s design while maintaining performance? Propose two ways to reduce cost and complexity (e.g., reducing I/O, moving some tasks to FPGA, or using software-based solutions).

Also, should the board be manufactured in-house or outsourced?

- If you suggest outsourcing, how do you ensure the supply chain remains reliable and cost-effective (considering issues such as tariffs, availability of components, and shipping costs)?
- If in-house manufacturing is preferred, how would you manage production to reduce costs, especially when considering board size and the associated costs of different fabrication processes?
