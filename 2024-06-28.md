## Electronics
- Today we are going to take the focus away from finding the threshold equations and just find the threshold resistances as if they are hardcoded for the sake of setting up differential op amps and the coarse ADC
- *Main Focus for Today!!*

### Chosen Circuit
- By using the *equation heart* I decided to use an equation that uses the 

### Huge Breakthrough
- The values match the theoretical now! Everything works and I am so happy rn
- Going to bring so much to this meeting. 
## Cybersecurity
- Going to try and find some good DDoS attacks to use for the testing and run the probe test to figure out what infiltration and brute force attacks we will use.
