## Dr. Khan Meeting

- I will leave my apartment around 12pm to ensure I make it in time.

### ESP32-S3-EYE
- Did some experimenting with it.
- Decided not to use it since it had to be coded in a very specific way that I do not know how to do
- However, in the future, remember:

### Airmong-NG Driver
- RTL8812AU
- RTL8811AU

### Espressif IDF Code
```
idf.py set-target esp32-s3
idf.py build
