### Bystander Effect

The reduciton in helping behavior in the prsence of other people.

Reason why it happens:

- Legal consequences
- Mood-killer

How to *go against* the bystander effect:

1. Call 911

### What is an Upstander

Someone who sees what is happening and intervenes, interrupts, or speaks up to stop harm.

```ad-check

1. If you are feeling that you should intervene, others are too. And they will support you.
2. As a member of Theta Chi, it is your responsibility to counteract the bystander effect
```

As a Theta Chi, it is our mission to be an upstander. It goes with our:
- Mission
