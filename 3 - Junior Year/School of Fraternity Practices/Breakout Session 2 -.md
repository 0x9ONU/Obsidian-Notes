## Definitions

**Culture** - The customs, arts, social institutions, and achievements of a particular nation, people or other social group

**Prejudice** - An opinion that is not based on reason or actual experience.

**Equity** - The state, quality or ideal of being just, impartial and fair. It is a dynamic process that reinforces and replicates equitable ideas, resources, strategies, habits and outcomes. Equity involves trying to understand and give people what they need to enjoy full, healthy lives.

**Equality** - The state of being equal, especially in status, rights, and opportunities. Like equity, equality aims to promote fairness and justice, but can only work if everyone starts form the same place and needs the same things.

**Tolerance** - The ability to tolerate something, in particular the existence of opinions or behavior that one does not necessarily agree with.

## Human Dignity Statement TLDR

Theta Chi’s position is that all people are to be *respected*:

```
"Regardless of race, creed, color, sex, age, religion, disability, sexual orientation, national origin, or ancestry."
```

```ad-important
Chapter image is tied greatly to this point. Regardless of how good your chapter does on paper, not following the HDS and understanding culutre, prejudice, equity, equality, or tolerance will mean **nothing**.
```

```ad-note
A good thing to put into a Rush presentation and a good pitch
```
