## How to Share your Story $\star$

1. **Drop the Jargon**: Do not use terms that no one else will know. *Describe* the experience to them instead of using simple words that summarize it
2. **Focus on Belonging**: Put your experience forward. Utilize emotion (*how you fell*).
   `“Come as you are, and your chapter will feel like home. From day one, these people have been in my corner to help chase my dreams”`
3. **Let Them Behind the Scenes**: This generation wants to “try before they buy”. Recruitment experience can be scary, elitist, judgmental, etc. 66% of people that are interested feel like they will be judged. Post things about member’s daily life
4. **Focus More on Faces and Less on Fonts**: 
	- Step away from Canva and diagrams. Show people enjoying themselves. 
	- **More on Authenticity** LESS on edited life. 
	- What engages people? **Video, Collages, Photo, Graphics**
	- Show the fraternity/sorority in action
	- Let them try before they buy. Give members what they can expect from recruitment and the experience
	- Add your ideas: Why you joined your f/s, F/S BTS, someone you look up to, fave moment, making a difference, F/S pride, What it means to me. 
	- Take on the stereotypes: admit that it happens, but that *we are different*
5. **Connect Everything to your Value Proposition**: What is unique that you cannot get anywhere else
	- F/S life is not another ball, it *should touch how to juggle responsibilities*
	- What is your **value proposition**?
	- What do you want everyone to know?
