# Abstract

Can you remember the latest drama you heard between friend sin your chapter? Or the last hard conversation you had with another officer? From members shutting down when “called to standards” to abandoning friendships when a disagreement arises, we need a new roadmap to navigate interpersonal conflict in our communities. Recognizing the tendency to take conflict personally or deflect blame, let’s explore what could change the course of many of our relationships: resilience. With growth-mindset resolution strategies, get ready to retain members and sustain lifelong friendships in your community.

While safety is felt in this state of self-protection, staying here too long creates *greater distance*.
