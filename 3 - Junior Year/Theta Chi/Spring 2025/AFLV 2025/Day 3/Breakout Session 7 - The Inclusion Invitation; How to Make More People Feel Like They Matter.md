# Abstract

Inclusion is both an art and a science, pivotal for fostering vibrant and sustainable communities. As college students in fraternities and sororities, we recognize the value of inclusion but often struggle with its implementation. This session offers tangible strategies tailored for fraternity and sorority leaders to foster practical inclusivity. Join us to discover actionable techniques to enrich the fabric of our chapters and campuses. From embracing diverse perspectives to nurturing a culture of belonging, we’ll explore how to empower every member to contribute meaningfully. Let’s embark on this journey together to curate environments where every voice is respected, valued, and trusted.

# Introduction

## Story

She went to College in 2008:
- Freshman year went to Greek Week
- Put together a great performance and was the star
- Spent an entire week for a four minute performance
- Enjoyed every second of it.
- Was then the Panhel Greek Week Chair
- Tried to make it more inclusive
	- Went to the NPHC meeting where every one of the Divine 9 was on the council
	- Went to a bunch of meetings, and then got turned down
	- “Even though you are well-intended, you are not well-informed”
- Went through life, and then became the NBHC advisor in Perdue
	- Came to her that they were annoyed that a Panhel girl kept coming to her 
	- Including someone is *more* than just being *nice*

# It’s Noisy

```ad-important
Our inclusion efforts have not been more than just *being nice*.

```ad-quote
We don't need more chairs.. we *need* a new table
```

We are fighting against tradition when we want to be inclusive. We must get past that thought.
- Most of our traditions are rooted in *exclusion*

```ad-question
Who are we creating belonging for?
```

# What Exactly is DEI?

**Diversity** is a *fact*
**Equity** is a *choice*
**Inclusion** is an *action*
**Belonging** is an *outcome*

# What Do WE Do?

Who do we **allow**? The explicit message about whose invited (minimum qualifications)
- Some of them seem non-negotiable (GPA, Fees, etc.)
- We believe these people cannot be apart of this community for what?
- Typically made with “fast decisions"
- Is this still relevant?
Who do we **account** for? The people we consider when we make decisions
- We need to change who we account for
- The trust and perception cycle is critical to know
	- What is your “Spirit Airlines” of your governing councils
	- If we want to do too much, people might want to push away if they think they don’t want to do too much

```ad-example
Why might Sunday at 6pm not work for?
- Commuters
- Parents
- Weekend Workers
```

Who do we **encourage**? The people we really want to accept our invitation
- **WE** have control over it
- We have to tell people directly more often about exactly what happens during recruitment, pledgeship, etc.
- We treat people differently depending how similar and different they are
- What is the one thing you can do differently? Might be better to *stop* something than *start* something

# Closing Remark

It’s not inclusion if you are inviting people into a space you are *unwilling* to change.
