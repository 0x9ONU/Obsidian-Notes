# Abstract

Have you ever felt out of place, like you don’t belong? Maybe you’ve been elected to serve your organization and don’t feel like you’re qualified. Turns out, you’re not alone. A study from the Journal of Behavioral Science found that 70% of people feel like an imposter at some point. Let’s dive into understanding that little annoying voice that tells us we’re not good enough, or not ready enough, just not enough in general, while giving mindset tips and tricks you can use for the rest of your life.

# Introduction

```ad-note
This topic can be *intimidating*. But life can ALSO be intimidating
```

The only thing different between us now and being born is that we now wear clothes. Many of us do not know how to actually process feelings within ourselves and with others

‘If you *always* fake it, do you ever really make it?’

```ad-important
You do not need to keep fitting into identities that you feel others want you to be in.
```

# Imposter Syndrome

```ad-summary
It *does not exist*. It is not a diagnosis of a disease, but a **collection of feelings**
```

## The History of Imposter Syndrome

In the 1970s, some C-Suite women felt that they had to work twice as hard to get to where they are. 
- Found that both most women and minorities felt it
- They then found that *people* feel it
- A younger turn than masculinity

## How Does it Manifest?

Manifests *differently* from person-to-person.

Can differ based on many factors such as:
- Age
- Race
- Placement in Society
- Identity
- Jobs
- etc.

### The Facts

- **NSF** found that *80%* felt the feeling of imposter syndrome in their life.
- Of all of these thoughts, *95%* of our negative thoughts are **repetitive**

```ad-important
WE have to break the negative thoguht patterns we have before they spiral.
```

### Sense of Belonging

We have an innate sense of belonging:
- However, we often feel that we are not *good* enough and do not belong since “you are not enough”
- “If I do one more thing, *then* I will be enough”

```ad-quote
"Senior aptethy is caused by poor leadership"
```

### Limitation

```ad-important
All limitations are self-imposed. We can lead to change *if* we break past our own **comfort**
```

What *lies* do you end up Be*lie*ving

```ad-quote
Everyone fails at who they're *supposed* to be. The measure of a person, of a hearo, is how well **they succeed**.
```

Are you willing to put in the work to make change?

## Tagline

```ad-question
What sentence would you use to how you take on your life?
```

## Seeing the Potential in Others and Yourself

```ad-quote
"When you care about yourself as much as you carea bout what other people think, you will change yourself"
```

We need to break through to get through
- You cannot compare yourself to others both in person and *online*
- Some people will not see the potential in you and not think of you much
- *Others* will see the potential in you and push you up.

# Exercise: What Will You Believe?

## Believe…

- **EVERYONE** has imposter syndrome
- Your thoughts are your *biggest weapons*
- If you can believe them in *them* for about a decade: Then you can believe yourself for five minutes
- You are **allowed** to be **proud of yourself** for things that might seem small to other people.
- **YOU** define success
- Don’t compare your chapter *one* to someone else’s chapter *20*
- Someone else’s way is *not your way*
- You *are* a **BADASS**
- Both the negative and positive thoughts are important, but don’t let the negative one take the wheel.

## Make a Things you Love List

```ad-question
Make a list of things that you LOVE.
```

```ad-example
1. My family

3. Fraternity Brothers (most of them)
4. Music
5. Video Games
6. Playing Instruments
7. Balisongs
8. Sleep
9. Taco Bell
10. etc...
```

**|| What’s not on the list? YOURSELF||** 

- Not loving yourself makes it so you cannot get over your self apathy
- You *MUST* put yourself first
