# Abstract

Ever had a conversation blow up in your face? Do you find yourself avoiding difficult conversations or any kind of confrontation with others? When the stakes are high and emotions are running strong, simple conversations can take a turn and transform into crucial ones. Sometimes instead of communicating with others, you find yourself crafting an alternative story about what happened. Come learn more about crucial conversations and how to navigate things when the going gets tough.

# Introduction

```ad-important
We must have to be okay with:
- Being wrong
- Making mistakes
```

We like to call people stupid/idiots too fast, but you sometimes have to take a step back and understand:
1. Lived experiences can be different
2. Their point of view might differ
3. It is better to have a conversation than accusing someone

*We are all a puzzle piece in a big lived experience*

We need to learn:
- How to ask better questions
- Use active-listening
- How to be wrong

## Conflict

```ad-question
1. What comes to mind when you think about conflict?
2. How does it make you feel?
3. How do you show upi n conflict?
```

*My Answers*:
1. Different views on subjects, decisions, and ways of living that two or more people might disagree over
2. I often become scared/frightened of conflict. I do not want to hurt someone or see others get hurt.
3. I try my best to listen regardless of the subject at hand. I *try* to see both sides, but I can get defensive on certain issues.

```ad-important
Sometimes you just have to take the mistakes you made and own up to them. Course-correcting is okay, as long as 
```

## Intent vs. Impact

- You can say something while you feel like you are having a great energy
- You should go into a conversation making sure that you make yourself clear, but understand that mistakes can happen and your impact will be different.

**Casual → Crucial**: Things could be fine but then:
1. Opinions Vary
2. Stakes are High
3. Emotions Run Strong

```ad-note
We cannot let our emotions fly-high as casual->crucial can happen faster than you realize.
```

Sometimes you just have to walk away from a relationship/friendship and let it be if the stakes are too high.
- There can be a point-of-no-return

**Conflict does not have to be a scary thing, it can be beneficial.**
- We can learn from it and how to approach more situations like that in the future
- Sometimes we have to live through these experiences before you understand how to handle it.

# The Stories we Tell Ourselves

**Notice your Behavior**: If you find yourself moving away from dialogue, ask yourself what you’re really doing
- Am I in some form of silence or violence?

**Get in Touch with Your Feelings**: Learn to accurately identify the emotions behind your story.
- What emotions are encouraging me to act this way?
- Why do we not like person X or Y?

**Analyze Your Stories**: Question your conclusions are and look for other possible explanations behind your story.
- What story is creating these emotions

**Getting Back to the Facts**: Abandon your absolute certainty by distinguishing between hard facts and your invented story.
- What evidence do I have to support this story?
- Allows you to move away
- Challenge how you felt versus what is actually true

**Watch for Clever Stories**; Victim, villain, and helpless situations sit at the top of the list
- Our imagination can get the best of us
- You can feel personally attacked
- Try not to overthink on the situation

## Master My Stories

1. Learn to Look
2. Tone down your approach
3. Catch yourself

# My Path vs. Their Path

## State My Path
- State your facts
- Tell your story
- Ask for other’s paths
- Talk tentatively
- Encourage testing

## Listening Skills

1. Ask
2. Mirror
3. **Paraphrase**: Ask others about what they said, and make sure *you are understanding them correctly*. Prevents problems from happening in the future
4. Prime

# Rethinking

## Four Modes

1. **Preacher Mode:** You tell people what you think is true
2. **Prosecutor Mode**: You try to reason and marshal arguments
3. **Politician Mode**: We are trying to win over an audience
4. **Scientist Mode**: Trial and error and using the scientific method 

```ad-important
Be like a scientist. Be open-minded
```

“Changing your mind doesn’t make you a flip-flopper. It shows you are a learn”

“Opinions aren’t meant to be set in stone. They’re made to stretch like rubber.”

# Conclusion

```ad-important
You are in control of *you*. You get to decide how you react. You get to decide how you respond.
```
