## Competition of Stress

### Good Stress vs. Bad Stress


| Good Stress     | Bad Stress                  |
| --------------- | --------------------------- |
| Keeps you going | Stops you from doing things |
|                 |                             |

## The Brain
### Limbic System vs. Neocortex

Technology activates our Limbic System more often, which means we have become more impulsive than the past.

### Growing the Brain

Men’s brains are fully aged between 25-28, while women’s brains are fully developed by around 22

## How to Support Mental Health

1. Help a friend feel more comfortable with their situation
2. Ask open-ended questions to allow them to explain what is happening.
3. Listening can be enough. They don’t need to have answers.
4. Ask for help from an adult if it gets worse
5. Take care of their mental health during the process.
6. understand that they can’t be a therapist or psychologist.
7. Tell someone if a friend is suicidal

## A.S.K 

1. **Acknowledge**: Crate a supportive space by letting know you’re here for them
2. **Support**: Validate their feelings and ask what they need
3. **Keep-In-Touch**: Check back in regularly

## Coping

```ad-important
All coping mechanisms come from the mechanisms that we use in our brain.
```

All coping mechanisms go back to the synapses in our brain
- The more often you use it, the more often it becomes nature

The longer you use a coping mechanism:
- The more automatic it becomes
- The deeper the neural pathways get

**Between the ages of 12-25, that’s where you prepare them**

### Changing Ineffective Coping

1. You have to want o change ineffective coping
2. Identify the coping mechanism
3. Replace the ineffective coping mechanism
4. Spend plenty of time and effort to do so
5. It becomes automatic

## How to Lead Mental Health Conversations

1. Choose a story to share (your own or someone else’s WITH CONSENT)
2. Use a story you have emotionally processed
3. Make sure the story has a relevant point for a lesson
4. Center the learning objective and not yourself (the story isn’t personal validation)
5. Ensure the learning objective is *universal*

# Conclusion

We go through a checklist everyday until we end up in a place of *comfort*

```ad-important
Next time you are in your comfort zone, think about how you can express your internal life more.
