# What To Do
- Read paper four times
- They argue that this sensor will not work because there is no background
- Provide the fact that a transition gate will greatly improve the runaway current (Future Work)
- Provide the strong background
- We substituted the photodiode with a photoresistor
- Substituted M1 and M2 with a sample and hold
- Optocoupler/not a passing gate for M3
- Took the idea from the original paper and improved it through the regions and their equations
- Explain paper to someone who has not read it
