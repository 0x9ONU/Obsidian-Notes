## Summary

### Introduction

TPUs are units that are customized for use with high-dimensionality data found in AI processing operations. 

CPUs are the core of all generalized computing, but often need help from other chips to handle processing-heavy operations.

### What use are TPUs when GPUs exist?

GPUs, which were originally meant from graphics processing, can take advantage of multi-dimensional matrix operations on AI as well as graphics.

### What’s special about TPUs?

```ad-summary
title: Definition
**Tensor**: a form of matrix, or mutli-dimensional number, a key plank of AI processing that assigns and uses high-dimensional nubmers to objects to process them.
```

TPUs specifically are ASIC chips customized for calculating high-dimensional numbers. Specifically, it has MXUs to do the calculations
