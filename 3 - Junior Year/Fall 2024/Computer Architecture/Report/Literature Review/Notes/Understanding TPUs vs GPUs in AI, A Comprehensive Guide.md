## Summary

### Introduction

TPUs are specialized for AI computations and offer superior performance tailored for tasks like machine learning projects.

### What is a TPU?

- Unlike GPUs, TPUs were specifically designed to accelerate machine learning workloads
- Made for tensor operations, which are fundamental to deep learning algorithms
- Since they are made for matrix multiplication, they can process large volumes of data and executing complex neural networks efficiently.

### TPU vs. GPU

#### Computational Architecture

Both GPUs and TPUs are special hardware accelerators designed to enhance performance in AI tasks, but they differ in architecture.

#### TPUs

- Prioritize tensor operations
- Less cores than GPUs, but more than CPUs
- Allows them to outperform GPUs in certain AI tasks
- Very good for deep learning tasks that involve matrix operations.
- Less power hungry than GPUs and some CPUs (200-250 Watts)
- Typically integrated into cloud infrastructure, particularly Google Cloud Platform
	- Allows for a user to get more TPUs on demand at the cost of not owning the actual 

```ad-important
Choose TPUs when:
1. Your project is primarily TensorFlow-based and benefits from tight integration with TensorFlow's optimized performance.
2. High-throughput training and fast interference times are critical, such as in large-scale deep leanring model training or real-time applicaitons.
3. Energy efficiency and reduced power consumptiona re important considerations, particulary in large-scale deployments.
4. You prefer a maanged cloud service with seamless scalability and easy access via Google Cloud
