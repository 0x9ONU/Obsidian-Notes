title: Abstract
collapse: open
Tensor Cores enable mixed-precision computing, dynamically adapting calculations to accelerate throughput while preserving accuracy and providing enhanced security. The latest generation of Tensor Cores are faster than ever on a broad array of AI and high-performance computing (HPC) tasks. From 4X speedups in training trillion-parameter generative AI models to a 30X increase in inference performance, NVIDIA Tensor Cores accelerate all workloads for modern AI factories.

## Summary

### Introduction

```ad-important
Tensor Cores allow mixed-precision computing
```

This can:
- Accelerate throughput
- Preserve accuracy
- Provide security

4X speed-up for generative AI, 30X in interference performance

### Breakthrough Interference

Uses the second-generation Transformer Engine to accelerate multi-trillion-parameter generative AI models

### Advanced HPC

Can use simulations to better understand complex molecules for drug discovery, physics for potential sources of energy, and atmospheric data to better predict and prepare for extreme weather patterns.

```ad-important
Has a high amount of precsions for different scientific needs
```

### New Precision Formats

Provides new quantization formats and precision, which can be changed by the *community*.
