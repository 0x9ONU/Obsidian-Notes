# Pipelined Processor Hazards

When an instruction depends on result form instruction that hasnâ€™t completed yet.

Types:
- **Data Hazard**: Register value not yet written back to register file
- **Control Hazard**: Next instruction no decided yet (caused by branch)

## Handling Data Hazards

- Inset nops in code at compie time
- Rearrange code at compile time
- Forward data at run time
- Stall the processor at run time

### The Easy Way

- Insert enough `nops` for result to be ready
- Or move independent useful instruction forward

### Data Forwarding

Data is available on *internal busses* before it is written back to the register file (RF).

**Forward data** from internal busses to *Execute Stage*

Check if source register *in Execute stage* **matches** destination register of instruction *in Memory or Writeback Stage.*

#### Cases for Data Forwarding

**Case 1**: Execute stage `Rs1` or `Rs2` matches **memory** stage `Rd`? Forward from Memory stage

**Case 2:** Execute stage `Rs1` or `Rs2` matches **writeback** stage `rd`? Forward from WRiteback stage

**Case 3:** Otherwise, use value read from register file (as usual)

*For Rs1*:
```c
if ((Rs1E == RdM) && RegWriteM)
     ForwardAe = 10
else if ((Rs1E == RdW) && RegWriteW)
     ForwardAE = 01
else Foward AE = 00
```
