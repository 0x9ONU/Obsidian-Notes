## Interrupts: Mechanisms for Real-Time Applications

**Interrupts** are mechanism by which other modules (e.g. a button, a sensor, software) may interrupt the normal sequencing of the processor

Provided to improve processor utilization
- Most I/O devices are slower than the rpocessor
- Processor must pause to wait for device
- Wasteful use of the processor

### Classes of Interrupts

| Type             | Description                                                                                                                 |     |
| ---------------- | --------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------- | --- |
| Program          | Generated by some condition that occurs as a reuslt of insturction execution                                                |     |
| Timer            | Generated by a timer within the processor. This allows the operating system to perform certain functions on a regular basis |     |
| I/O              | Generated by an I/O controller, to signal normal operations                                                                 |     |
| Hardware Failure | Self-explanatory                                                                                                            |     |

# Microcontroller Architecture

![[ERTA - Week 1 Day 2 2024-08-28 13.11.57.excalidraw]]

## Types of System Architecture

There are **TWO** main types:

**Von-Neumann**

![[ERTA - Week 1 Day 2 2024-08-28 13.13.56.excalidraw]]

**Harvard**

![[ERTA - Week 1 Day 2 2024-08-28 13.14.58.excalidraw]]

```ad-important
The main difference between the two is that Harvard has a *separate* bus for data and instructions
```

## Instruction Set Architecture (ISA)

ISAs define how software interact with given hardware

An ISA might define the following for a given CPU
- Supported instructions
- SUpported data types
- Registers
- Database bus size
- HOw the CPU manages memory
- I/O management

```ad-example
- x86 (desktop)
- ARM (mobile)
- PowerPC (cars)
- SPRAC (server)
```

## Registers

Registers are the super fast storage in a CPU
- Very expensive, very fast
- Can contain:
	- Data
	- Addresses
	- Instructions
	- Process state information

```ad-note
Typically placed on the CPU die
