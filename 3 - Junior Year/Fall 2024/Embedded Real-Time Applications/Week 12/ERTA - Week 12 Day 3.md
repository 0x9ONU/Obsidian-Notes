## Transducer

```ad-summary
title: Definition
A device that converts energy from one form to another
```

![[ERTA - Week 12 Day 3 2024-11-15 13.06.51.excalidraw]]

```ad-example
1. **Temperature (Thermocoupler)**: $70 \degree F \rightarrow 7V$
2. **Microphone**: Converts an incoming sound signal into a low-current electrical signal
3. **Tachometer**: Converts rotational speed (RPM/RPS) into an electrical signal
```

## Control System

```ad-summary
title: Defintiion
A system that controls the behavior of a system.
```

```ad-example
1. **Thermostat**: Takes in a thermometer reading to turn a heater on and off to keep a constant temperature
2. **Automated Lights** $\mbox{Motion} \rightarrow \mbox{Lights}$
3. **Cruise Control** $\mbox{Tachometer} \rightarrow \mbox{Motor Power}$
```

## Actuator

```ad-summary
title: Definition
Takes electrical signals and prodcues force, torque, or displacement wiht an electrical signal
```

## Sampling Example

![[Signal_Sampling.svg.png]]

## Properties of Measurements

**Range**: The maximum input $x_{max}-x_{min}$ that a DAQ can measure

**Resolution**: The smallest change in input that can be detected by the DAQ

**Precision**: The variance in a single sensor reading

**Accuracy**: The average error in a sensor reading
