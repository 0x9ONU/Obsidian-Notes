```ad-note
Not to be confused with *software security* that focuses on:
- Exploitng different impolemantion bugs
- Techniques to ensure reliable software operation in presence of potential secuirty risks
```

This book will cover hardware and system security relating to:
- Embedded systems
- Cyber-physical systems (CPS)
- Internet of Thing (IoT)
- Biomedical systems

## 1.1 - Overview of a Computing System

Memory for information storage, processors for information processing, and I/O for interfacing with human users or other systems.
- They allow for the capturing and transformation of information, and communication with other systems.
- Typically, an analog device is also needed to store this information

```ad-summary
These systems have typically be broken up into two categories:
- General purpose systems
	- Includes desktops, laptops, servers
	- Complex architecture
	- Vesatile and easily programmable
	- Suitable for a large amount of scenarios
- Embedded systems
	- Includes digital cameras, home automation devices, wearable health monitors
	- Highly customized
	- Hardware-software integrated closely
	- Unique use-case constraints
	- Also part of the cyber-physical systems and IoT devices
```

```ad-note
Security implications of embedded systems
- Long and complex life, which may not follow newer security compliants
- Machine-to-machine communicaiton without any human in the loop
- Mass produciton of millions of machines with the same configuration, which could lead to one vulnerability affecting millions
```

Achieving security of an entire system of devices requires a significant rethinking on how to integrate specific security solutions for each component.

## 1.2 - Layers of a Computing System

![[Pasted image 20240830102611.png]]

### 1.2.1 - Electronic Hardware

The hardware in a computing system can consist of *three* layers:
- **System-level hardware**: The integration of all physical components that make a system
	- Includes peripheral devices and enclosures
- **Printed Circuit Board (PCBs)**: Provide mechanical support and electrical connection to electronic components.
	- Allow for power and signals to be connected via conductive traces often through multiple layers.
- **Active & Passive Components**: Includes ICs, transistors, and relays (active) as well as resistors, capacitors, and inductors (passive)

```ad-note
Each of these layers have their own complications and security issues that need to be considered
```

### 1.2.2 - Types of Electronic Hardware

ICs on PCBs do various tasks such as:
- Signal acquisition
- Transformation
- Processing
- Transfer

```ad-note
Some ICs are digital and work with only digital signals, where others focus on analog signals. AMS chips are mixed chips that work with both analog and digital signals.
```

**Application-Specific Integrated Circuits (ASIC)**: A class of ICs, which contain customized functionalities and meet specific performance targets that are not readily available in the market.

**Commercial Off-the-Shelf (COTS)**: Already available in the market and often provide flexibility and programmability to support a diverse system design needs.

## 1.3 - What is Hardware Security?

```ad-note
- The study of information and data security has been around for much longer than hardware security
- Hardware security is much newer since hardware was considered immune to attacks due to the "root-of-trust" anchor in systems
```

However, over the past three decades, many attacks have been reported to be caused by hardware vulnerabilities:
- Security concerns have been growing due to the trends in IP-based system on chip (SoC) designs being sent through a long and distributed supply chain.
- There is less control from a chip manufacture on both the design and fabrication steps.
  
```ad-example
- Hardware Trojan attacks
- Kill switch on device
- Side-channel attacks
``` 

**Side-Channel attacks**: Secret information about a chip can be extracted through measurement and analysis of side-channels
- Can include power, signal propagation delay, and electromagnetic emission.
- Can lead to IP piracy, counterfeiting, probe attacks on the ICs, physical tampering of traces, bus snooping, access to privileged resources.

**Software Stack**:
- Hardware must be designed, implemented, and validated properly to ensure that the software stack is secure and reliable
- Deals with Trusted execution environments (TEEs) that protect code and data of an application from other untrusted applications using confidentiality, integrity, and availability.
- Also deals with the protection of security-critical assets on an SoC through realization and security policies.

## 1.4 - Hardware Security vs. Hardware Trust

Unlike hardware security issues, *hardware trust* issues arise from untrusted entities in the life cycle of the hardware.
- Untrusted IP or CAD tool vendors
- Design
- Fabrication
- Test
- Distribution

They are able to violate the trustworthiness of a hardware component or system.

```ad-example
An untrusted IP vendor can include malicious implants into a design, which can lead to DoS, or information leakage attacks during operation.
```

### 1.4.1 - What Causes Hardware Trust Issues?

![[Pasted image 20240830141953.png]]

An IC will go through various steps in its life cycle:
- Design house (Specifications)
- Design and verification steps (HDL)
- Physical layout
- Fabrication
- Testing ICs
	- Design-for-test (DFT) and Design-for-debug (DFD) is often used to help create a pathway for fast debugging and testing
	- However, this might allow direct access to read/write control on a processor through these interfaces
- Distribution

### 1.4.2 - What Security Issues Result from Untrusted Entities?

Since supply changes have happened to become more diverse both literally and physically, some concerns have been made that third-party IP vendors can insert malicious designs or components onto a board, or steal an IP.

## 1.5 - Attacks, Vulnerabilities, and Countermeasures

### 1.5.1 Attack Vectors

**Attack Vectors**: The means or paths for bad actors (attackers) to get access to hardware components for malicious purposes.
- Enable an attackers to exploit implementation level issues
- Take advantage of lack of control on hardware production cycle

```ad-example
- Side-CHannel Attacks
- Trojan attacks
- IP piracy
- PCB tampering
```

### 1.5.2 Attack Surface

**Attack Surface**: The sum of all possible security risk exposures. It is an aggregate of:
- Known, unknown, and potential vulnerabilities
- Controls across all hardware, software, and network components.

![[Pasted image 20240830153756.png]]

#### Chip Level Attacks

Chips can be targeted with the following attacks:
- Reverse engineering
- Cloning
- Malicious insertion
- Side-channel attacks
- Piracy

```ad-note
Fake chips are often sold as original units and replicate the appearance and/or the functionality of the chip.
```

Trojan-infected chips can get into the supply chain, which can cause unauthorized access or malfunction.

Side-channel attacks try to find secret information stored inside of a chip

#### PCB-Level Attacks

```ad-note
A much more common target then ICs, since they are easier to tamper with and reverse engineer
```

Signal processing and optical inspection is often enough to get most the information off of modern PCBs.

Attackers may also physically tamper with a PCB to either leak information or bypass DRM.

#### System-Level Attacks

Target the interaction between hardware and software mounted on the system. Directly target the most vulnerable part in a system, such as DFT infrastructure.

### 1.5.3 - Security Model

A security model should have *two* key components:
1. *Threat Model*: describes the treats including the purpose and mechanism of the attack
2. *Trust Model*: The trusted parties and components

### 1.5.4 - Vulnerabilities

```ad-summary
title: Definition
Weaknesses in hardware architecture, implementation, or design/test process, which can be exploited by an attacker to mount an attack.
```

**Functional Bug**: Most common vulnerability caused by bugs and poor design/testing practices
- Weak cryptographic hardware implementation
- inadequate protection of assets in an SoC

**Side-Channel Bug**: Implementation-level issues that leak critical information stored inside a hardware component.
- The strongest versions rely on statistical methods to analyze the measured traces of the parameters

**Test/Debug Infrastructure**: Most hardware systems have debug modes that can also be misused by attackers to get sensitive information or unwanted control of a system

**Access control or information-flow issues:** A system might misinterpret an authorized user to have permissions. This can lead to secret assets and functionality revealed to an attacker.

### 1.5.5 - Countermeasures

![[Pasted image 20240830162016.png]]

## 1.6 - Conflict Between Security and Test/Debug

Placing security on SoCâ€™s test/debug areas may lead to it being more difficult to effectively debug a chip, which is a critical step in its life cycle.

```ad-warning
Current industrial practice makes it difficult to add any security to the debug pathways.
```

## 1.7 - Evolution of Hardware Security: A Brief Historical Perspective

![[Pasted image 20240830162619.png]]

**Timing Attacks- 1996:** An attack which aims to extract information from cryptographic hardware on the basis of systematic analysis.

**Fault Injection - 1997**: Focuses on applying environmental stress to a system to force it to leak data.

**Power Analysis Attacks - 1999**: Focused on analyzing the power dissipations at runtime to retrieve secrets from a cryptochip.

**Hardware Tagging - 1998**: Every IC instance was assigned with a unique ID.

**Early 2000s**: physical unclonable functions (PUFs) and true random number generators (TRNG) were introduced

**Counterfeit ICs - 2005:** First reports of cloned and recycled chips

**Trojans - 2007**: Possibility of inserting malicious circuits in a hardware design to disrupt/change normal behavior. 

**DARPA ISIS Program - 2008**: Created by the US DoD to develop techniques for hardware integrity and reliability through destructive and nondestructive analysis

**Counterfeits in the US Air Force - 2012**: Over 1 million counterfeit devices were found, which ended in an amendment that enforces counterfeit-avoidance practices.

**DARPA SHIELD - 2014**: Program to help develop technology to trace and track electronic components - PCB to chip to small passive components - as they move through the supply chain.
