## Question 9: Side-Channel Countermeasures

```ad-question
How can side-channel attack counter meausres protect the device? How would these countermeasures affect the performance of the system?
```

## Question 10: FPGA vs. Microcontroller

```ad-question
How can an attacker perform side-channel attacks on parallel based systems such as FPGAs? And how different is it compared to microcontrollers?
```

## Question 11: EM Analysis in a Noisy Environment

```ad-question
Applying EM analysis to capture critical information can be tricky, many factors can affect the quality of the signal. What measures should the attacker take to successfully perfrom the attack in a noisy environment? And what are the pros and cons of applying EM analysis over power analysis in this case?
```

## Question 12: Random Delay

```ad-question
Analyzing the delay of the output of a device can be used to gain knowledge about the design, one countermeasure used is to randomize the delays every time an operation is performed. How can this random delay be implemented? What are the challenges that the designer may face when applying this countermeasure?
