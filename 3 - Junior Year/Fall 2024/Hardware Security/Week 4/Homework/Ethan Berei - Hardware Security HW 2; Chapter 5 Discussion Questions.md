## Question 1: Semiconductor Industry Shift to Horizontal Business Model

```ad-question
Describe the motives of the semiconductor industry to shift to a horizontal business model and how the horizontal business model introduces the risk of hardware Trojan insertion
```

Before discussing how the horizontal business model affects the semiconductor industry, it is important to describe how the typical life span of a standard semiconductor goes through before it hits the market. On a computer, the creator would make a model of the semiconductor using a *hardware descriptive language* (HDL) to describe the functions of the chip. Then, the HDL is synthesized into small components and is typically done down to the gate level. Then, these components are laid out during the placement step. This step is where the physical synthesized model is placed into different cells on a chip. Then, the pieces are routed together to create the electrical traces between them. After that, the design is sent to a fabrication plant for them to be made, tested, and then loaded with the proper firmware before its packaged and sent to the customer.

When integrated circuits were first made by semiconductor companies, typically every step of the way was done through the vertical integration model.
