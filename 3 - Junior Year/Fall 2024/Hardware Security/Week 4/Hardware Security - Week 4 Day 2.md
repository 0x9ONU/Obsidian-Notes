- Special Topic: Lebanon Pager Attack

```

# Special Lecture: Discussing Current Events

## Background

A **militia** in Lebanon, which has around *2 million* supporters aka about 1/3 of the population.
- Against the current government
- There are about 60,000 soldiers
- There primary and only ally is **Iran**
- They are in the need of:
	1. Weapons (From Cold-War Era Russia)
	2. Communication (**Wired** or **Wireless**)

**Communication**:
- They decided to go for wireless because wired ended up being too difficult
- Went with *pagers* and *walkie-talkies*
	- Both of them use very LOW frequencies and are used for low-quality rural communications.

**Pagers**:
- Pagers are primarily used for ER or Hospitals
- One-way communication
- *Assumed* to be the most secure wireless communication

### Five Months Prior…

```ad-note
**Iran** is heavily sanctioned. This means Iran cannot go to the common markets to get materials to develop technology for their people/armies.
- They do not have the same level of electronic supply chain trust as the rest of the world
- They have to buy from black markets
```

The militia received new pagers and walkie-talkies from Iran via secret channels
- Due to the war between them and their neighbors
- They received the `Gold Apollo Ap900` OR `Gold Apollo AR924`

```ad-important
Today, the company who made these pagers said he made a mistake *four years ago*. He franchised his name to another company in Budapest, Hungary.

### What Happened Yesterday?

At *3 pm*, three thousand explosions went off.

```ad-note
The following people were not affected:
- People who had their pager off
- People who *turned off* their devices
- People who are in remote areas had no access to communication
```

The people who had them on had their pager explode:
- The explosion waited four seconds after *receiving a message*

```ad-important
This is one of the most *targeted* attacks that have ever occured.
```

It is *assumed* that **Israeli government** is the group behind this attack.

### What happened today?

The walkie-talkies are now the target and are exploding

## What could have happened?

Each Pager has a Lithium Ion Battery:
- Lithium batteries are VERY dangerous without proper power management.
- The system should have a good amount of battery storage
	- Even though it does not consume much power, it *should not* be charged often.

The “fake” devices might have been tampered
- Had an explosion on them that was hidden.
- Assumed 20g of a specific explosive.
