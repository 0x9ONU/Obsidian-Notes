# Review Questions

![[Review of chapter 5 and class discussion questions.pdf]]

## Answer One

- Look at lecture 1 and the first lecture of chapter 5

## Answer Two

- You are worried about
	- **SoC Designer**
	- **Third party IPs**
	- BIST: insert components for testability
	- Testing
	- CAD Tools
	- **Foundry**

## Answer Three-Five

Bring up the following:
- How they are typically made and what do they do
- Difference between combinational and sequential
- How MOLES work

## Answer Six

Between FPGA and ASICs:

| FPGA                    | ASIC                                          |
| ----------------------- | --------------------------------------------- |
| Reconfigurable Hardware | One-and-done (Must be fabricated)             |
| Fast Time to Market     | Slow Time to Market (HDL $\rightarrow$ GDSII) |
| More Expensive          | Cheaper                                       |
| Slower                  | Specialized (10x than FPGAs)                  |

```ad-note
FPGA does *NOT* need to worry about the fabrication part of it
FPGA needs to be worried about the **3PIP**
Testing can be much easier (most of the time in house)
```

## Answer Seven

```ad-important
Focus on Lecture 3
```

## Answer Eight

*Basically the entirety of Lecture 5 Summarized*
