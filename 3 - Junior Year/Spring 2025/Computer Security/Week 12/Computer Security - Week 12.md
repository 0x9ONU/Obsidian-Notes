# Intrusion Detection

## Classes of Intruders

### Cyber Criminals

Individuals or members of an organized crime group with a goal of financial reward

### Activists

Either individual, usually working as insiders, or members of a larger group of outsider attackers, who are motivated by social or political causes.

Aim of their attacks is often to promote and publicize their cause through:
- Website defacement
- Denial of service
- Theft and distribution of data that results in negative publicity or compromise of their targets

### State-Sponsored

Groups of hackers sponsored by governments to conduct espionage or sabotage

### Other

Hackers with motivations other than those previous listed:
- Include classic hackers or crackers who are motivated by technical challenge or by peer-group esteem and reputation
- Many of those are responsible for finding vulnerabilities for fun

## Skill Levels

### Apprentice

Hackers with minimal technical skill who primarily use existing attack toolkits
- Most of attackers
- Easiest to defend against
- “Script-kiddies”

### Journeyman

Hackers with sufficient technical skills to modify and extend attack toolkits to use discovered, or purchased, vulnerabilities

### Master

Hackers with high-level technical skills capable of discovering brand new categories of vulnerabilities
- Write the toolkits
- Employed by state-sponsored groups
- Defending against these attacks are the highest difficulty
