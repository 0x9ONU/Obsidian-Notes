# Summary of Work Period

During the work period, I decided to spend the entire time working on the Project 1 Assignment. In one hour, I gathered a large set of sources that will be used throughout the paper and wrote the first three paragraphs of the attack analysis and created Figure 1 in the report.

# Reflection

Overall, if I had to grade myself, I would give myself an 80 out of 100. During this time, I felt that I could have gotten more accomplished. I was distracted by emails on topics such as finalizing composites for an organization, and making sure I respond to all the emails that came into my inbox during that hour. Because of this, I felt like I was not as productive as I could have been, especially for a work hour that should have been dedicated to this course. In the future, I would turn off email notifications and focus solely on the task at hand. However, I do believe that the work that I did was well-written and gave a great head start into writing the paper that would have been difficult without a time like this. I have been so busy the past few weeks that this time finally gave me a dedicated hour to work on the project with minimal interruptions. I would appreciate more class study periods like this in the future if class were to ever be cancelled again.
