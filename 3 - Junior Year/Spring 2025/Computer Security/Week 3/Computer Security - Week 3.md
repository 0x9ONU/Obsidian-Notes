4. *Trust*: A target believes the attacker is trust worthy because the attacker has built a connection with the target
5. *Consensus*: A target believes the attacker’s suggested action has been done by others
6. *Scarcity*: A target believes the attacker’s suggestion actions has limited availability
7. *Urgency*: A target believes the attacker’s suggested action has a time constraint.
