# Cryptography

## Historical Cryptography

**Enigma Machine**

## Scenarios

1. Alice stores her medical records on a cloud server. Bob, a malicious actor, breaches the server’s security. - Loss of Confidentiality
2. Alice wants to send a message to Bob. Mallory, a MITM, intercepts their communication

## Cryptography Privatives

```ad-important
The *purpose* of this is for:
1. Confidentiality
2. Data Integrity
3. Authenticity
4. Non-Repudiation
```

## Applications

- Secure Communication
- Identification & Authentication 
- Secret Sharing / Data Hiding
- E-Commerce / E-payment
- Key Recovery
- Remote Access
- Cell Phone
- Access Control

## Historical Cryptosystems

**Symmetric Key Cryptography Techniques**:

*Substitution*:
- Monoalphabetic Substitution Cipher (ROT13)
- Polyalphabetic Substitution Cipher
- Shift cipher
- Caesar Cipher

*Transposition*
- Permutation Cipher
- Columnar Transposition Cipher
- Rail Fence Cipher

### Permutation Cipher Example

PT `HELLO`
k    `31245`
CT `LHELO`

CT `LHELO`
k    `31245`
PT `HELLO`

### Columnar Transposition Cipher

PT `THENOSEISPOINTINGDOWN`
k     `ANALYST` → `1423756`

## Asymmetric Encryption

One *public key* to encrypt the data and one *private* key to decrypt the data
- A combination of the encryption and decryption function
- Key pair generated by a mathematical function
- Ex. RSA, DH, Digital Signature Algorithm

![[Asymmetric-Encryption-Works.png]]

## Symmetric Encryption

Uses the same key to encrypt and decrypt the data
- Uses short keys and simpler operations
- Faster and more efficient than asymmetric key
- Includes **Stream** and **Block** Ciphers

Two requirements:
- Need a strong encryption algorithm
- Sender and receiver must have obtained copies of the secret key in a secure fashion and must keep the key secure

```ad-warning
It is vulnerable to cryptanalytic attacks (based on the known plaintexts and ciphertexts) and bruteforce attacks (tries all keys)
```

### Stream Cipher

The type of encryption that encrypts/decrypts each bit as they come along using **XOR Gates**
- Processes input elements continuously
- Produces output one element at a time
- Primary advantage is that they are almost always faster and use far less code

![[Pasted image 20250210144820.png]]

```ad-warning
Attackers can fuse/splice malicous bits into a stream cipher, and there is no easy way for a victim to detect it.
```
### Block Cipher

- Processes the input one block of elements at a time
- Produces an output block for each input block
- Can *reuse keys*
- More common

## Data Encryption Standard (DEA/DES)

Was one of the most widely used encryption scheme (made in the 1970s)

DES takes a 64 bits plaintext block and a 56 bits key to produce a 64 bits ciphertext block
- Uses 16 rounds of encryption
- Each round uses transposition and substitution with the 56-bit key to make the ciphertext

*Concerns*: The algorithm itself & the key
- It is the most studied encryption algorithm in existence
- The speed of commercial off-the-shelf processors makes this key length woefully inadequate
- Can be broken within ~1 day

### Double DES

Uses *two keys* ($K_1$ and $K_2$) one after another (32 rounds, 16 per key). Ended up *not being effective*. Only ended up being the equivalent of 57-bit key

### Triple DES (3DES)

Repeats basic DES algorithm three times using either two or three unique keys. 
- Used in the ANSI standard for financial applications in 1985

**Attractions:**
- 168-bit key length overcomes the vulnerability to brute-force attack of DES (equivalent of around 80-bits)
- Underlying encryption is the same as DES

*Drawbacks*:
- Algoirthm is sluggish in software
- Uses a 64-bit block size (pretty small amount of data at one time)

## Advanced Encryption Standard (AES)

### Reason for Creation

- 3DES was not reasonable for long term use
- Should have a security strength equal to or better than 3DES
- Significantly improve the efficiency
- Symmetric block cipher
- 128 bit data and 128/192/256 bit keys

Went through 15 proposals down to 5, which Rijndael was chosen in 2001

### Round Counts

128→ 10 rounds
192→ 12 rounds
256 → 14 rounds

```ad-important
Can be expanded to more rounds to have a larger key
```

## Block Cipher Comparisons


| —                     | DES | 3DES       | AES              |
| --------------------- | --- | ---------- | ---------------- |
| Plaintext block size  | 64  | 64         | 128              |
| Ciphertext block size | 64  | 64         | 128              |
| Key size              | 56  | 112 or 168 | 128, 192, or 256 |
