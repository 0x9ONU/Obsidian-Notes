# VLSI Research Assignment: Clock Skew and Noise Margins under VDD Scaling

## Objective:

This assignment is designed to deepen your understanding of two critical challenges in modern VLSI design:

1. Clock Skew
2. Noise Margins under Reduced VDD (Supply Voltage)

You will investigate both topics through research and present a thoughtful analysis of the causes, consequences, and potential mitigation strategies for each.

## Instructions:

For each topic, write a concise report (1–2 pages per topic) that includes:
- A brief explanation of the issue.
- Why it becomes a significant challenge in deep submicron technologies.
- Examples or case studies from literature or real-world designs.
- A discussion of solutions or mitigation techniques (e.g., design strategies, CAD tool support, circuit-level techniques).
- At least two scholarly sources (conference papers, journal articles, technical reports) cited per topic.

## Formatting:

- Typed, 11–12 pt font, single or 1.15 line spacing.
- Include diagrams, timing diagrams, or figures where appropriate (with captions).
- References in IEEE or ACM format at the end.

## Evaluation Criteria:

- Understanding of Concepts
- Depth of Analysis & Use of Sources
- Quality of Proposed Solutions
- Clarity, Structure, and Presentation
