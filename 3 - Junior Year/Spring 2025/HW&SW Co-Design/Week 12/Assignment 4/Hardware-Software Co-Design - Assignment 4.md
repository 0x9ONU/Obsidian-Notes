# VLSI: Clock Skew and Noise Margins under VDD Scaling

## Clock Skew

### Introduction

**Clock skew** is the maximum difference among clock paths, which can have a negative performance impact on synchronous sequential circuits on integrated circuits (ICs) and system-on-chips (SoCs). This skew can lead to incorrect data latching for registers, timing violations, and general system instability as a chip runs for a long time [1]. In the past decade, the electronic device market has shifted rapidly towards solutions that require low-power components with scalable technologies. Therefore, large clock distribution networks (CDNs) have to become standard across devices. Due to these changes, the clock signal has been degregated as it moves across the processor, causing clock skew [2].
