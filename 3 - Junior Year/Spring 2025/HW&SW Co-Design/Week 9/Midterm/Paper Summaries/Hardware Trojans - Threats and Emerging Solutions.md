#### **1. Introduction**

The paper addresses the growing concern of **Hardware Trojans**—malicious modifications to integrated circuits (ICs) during design or fabrication—which can compromise security, especially in safety-critical applications. Modern ICs are vulnerable due to offshore manufacturing, third-party IP cores, and outsourced design services, making them susceptible to adversarial attacks. Traditional verification and testing methods are insufficient for detecting Trojans due to their stealthy nature, rare activation conditions, and vast design space.

#### **2. Hardware Trojan Taxonomy and Examples**

Trojans are classified based on **trigger** and **payload** mechanisms (Fig. 2):

- **Trigger Mechanisms**:
    
    - **Digital**:
        
        - _Combinational_: Activated by rare logic conditions (e.g., A=0,B=0A=0,B=0 in Fig. 3(a)).
            
        - _Sequential_: Activated by rare sequences (e.g., counters or state machines (Fig. 3(b-d))).
            
    - **Analog**: Use sensors (e.g., temperature, voltage) to trigger payloads (Fig. 3(e-f)).
        
- **Payload Mechanisms**:
    
    - _Digital_: Alter logic values or memory contents.
        
    - _Analog_: Affect circuit parameters (e.g., delay, power, aging) (Fig. 4(a-b)).
        
    - _Information Leakage_: Exfiltrate data via side channels (e.g., power traces, RF signals).
        
    - _Denial of Service (DoS)_: Disrupt functionality.
        

#### **3. Trojan Detection Methods**

Detection techniques are categorized as **destructive** or **non-destructive** (Fig. 5):

- **Destructive Techniques**:
    
    - Involve de-packaging and reverse-engineering ICs (e.g., SEM imaging).
        
    - Limitations: Costly, time-consuming, and non-scalable.
        
- **Non-Destructive Techniques**:
    
    - **Invasive (Design-Time)**:
        
        - _Prevention_: Obfuscate designs to hide rare triggers (e.g., state-space expansion [12]).
            
        - _Detection Assistance_: Enhance controllability/observability (e.g., "transparent mode" in modules [13]).
            
    - **Non-Invasive (Run-Time/Test-Time)**:
        
        - _Run-Time_: Monitor in-field behavior (e.g., hardware guards [19], bus architectures [17]).
            
        - _Test-Time_:
            
            - _Logic Testing_: Use statistical methods (e.g., "N-detect" [20]) to activate rare triggers (Fig. 7).
                
            - _Side-Channel Analysis_: Measure power, delay, or leakage to detect anomalies (Fig. 8). Challenges include process variations and noise.
                

#### **4. Challenges and Future Directions**

- **Detection Gaps**: Analog Trojans, ultra-small Trojans, and scalable validation remain unsolved.
    
- **Integrated Metrics**: Need for trust quantification combining design and test methods.
    
- **Emerging Solutions**: Hybrid approaches (logic + side-channel) and hardware-software co-designs (e.g., [18, 35]) show promise.
    

#### **5. Conclusion**

Hardware Trojans pose a critical threat, requiring multi-layered countermeasures. No single solution exists; a combination of design-time obfuscation, test-time statistical/side-channel methods, and run-time monitoring is essential. Future work must address scalability, analog Trojans, and real-world validation.
