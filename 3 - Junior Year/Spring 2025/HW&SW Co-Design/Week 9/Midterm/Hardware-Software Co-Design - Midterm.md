# Detection and Prevention of Hardware Trojans 

## Introduction

When discussing the importance of security in computer systems, most people will have examples of software or network vulnerabilities come into their head.  For example, the WannaCry ransom worm that spread and affected around a million computers in 2017 by exploiting a day zero exploit found Windows operating systems [1]. However, in the past decade, a new set of vulnerabilities were found on the physical hardware found in both system-on-chips (SoCs) and integrated circuits (ICs). Unlike typical software vulnerabilities, these exploit at a permission level even lower than firmware and bios, which can lead to attacks that are much more difficult to pull off when compared to any other attack. However, these attacks are the most rewarding and dangerous if they are pulled off correctly. These vulnerabilities and how to counteract them became the field known as *hardware security* [2].

Underneath the hardware security umbrella, one of the most successful attacks utilized are called **hardware Trojans**. During the design or manufacturing of a chip, a malicious actor will modify an existing design to change the functionality, reduce the reliability, or leak valuable information off of a chip [2-4]. Modern ICs are particularly vulnerable to such an attack due to a globalized supply chain, over-reliance on third-party IPs, and manufacturing/design being outsourced. Being physically placed on a device, it makes it particularly difficult to stop/remove when it goes into affect and may not reveal it’s true nature for years. Therefore, both detection and prevention methods are crucial in stopping hardware Trojans from propagating. In this report, the different types of hardware Trojans and how they work will be revealed. Then, case studies found in the current literature and the real-world are presented to illustrate how hardware Trojans affect the landscape of security. Finally, the current detection techniques are discussed while a proposed approach will be presented that can best be used to counteract hardware Trojans.

## Hardware Trojans: How Do They Work?

Before discussing how hardware Trojans exploit the attack surface of hardware, a discussion around the shift in the business model around SoC and IC fabrication must be had. From a high-level, chips will go through seven stages in their lifecycle: IP vendor hardware description (HDL), SoC designing/synthesis, component placement, trace routing, fabrication, and distribution. When chips were first being designed, it was extremely common for a single company to hold all the facilities, staff, and tools in order to fully fabricate and ship an entire batch of SoCs or ICs. This vertical integration was a common business model for many years as it allowed companies to make everything in house, cutting down on costs at the time. However, as globalization became much more common, their was a shift for companies to move manufacturing and design to third parties oversee. Also known as horizontal integration, chip manufactures found that it would be more cost-effective and fast to have long and globally distributed supply chains after a post-globalized economy. With a full-scale 65nm process fabrication facility costing over $3 billion, chip designers in the United States decided it would be cheaper to send their IPs oversee to fabricate their chips. As more complex methods for manufacturing chips became standard, companies did not have the labor force or the investment to put into an ever-expanding market [2, 5]. This trend remains true as all American companies send their chips to another country if they are below a 10nm process. This has led to the United States being responsible for about 12% of all chip manufacturing, which is down by 25% when compared to the late 1990s. This lack of fabrication plants when it comes to the cutting-edge is why designers in the United States must follow the horizontal business model. Figure 1 below illustrates how much each major semiconductor competitor owns depending on the chip’s node size:

Not only that, an electronics manufacturer may choose to go with multiple different fabrications facilities or designers to create different parts of an SoC or a larger system. This issue is continuously compounded to create the **IC/IP Trust Problem**. On every step of getting a chip to the market, there is a chance that an untrusted third-party might either provide a faulty IP, place malicious components during the fabrication of the chip, and even falsify the testing process to bypass any checks that might catch the vulnerability [3]. Specifically, there are four types of attackers that can place malicious components onto a chip: design attackers, synthesis attackers, fabrication attackers, and distribution attackers. In the design phase, a malicious actor may compromise either an IP or the source code of the component and place a vulnerability on the HDL level. During a synthesis attack, the CAD tools that are used to turn the HDL into a synthesized design are manipulated such that it places Trojans. A fabrication attack is the most common as masks or the layout geometry can be easily changed on a chip in order to place malicious components. On the distributor side, they might tamper with the packaged IC to include a Trojan before it is sent out [7]. These vulnerabilities, if not caught, can quietly affect every chip that goes through and lead to a major security risk down the road.

**Hardware Trojans** take advantage of the attack surface provided by untrusted IPs or fabrication facilities. When a hardware Trojan is placed in a benign circuit, it often remains hidden without any major change in any of the values in the IC. This allows a chip to be used for an extended period of time before a hardware Trojan activates or is discovered on a chip. To accomplish this, a hardware Trojans consist of two major components: a *trigger* and a *payload*. 

A trigger is a condition that is used to determine when a Trojan activates. The most common type of triggers use *digital* signal re-rerouting to create an unlikely event. Combinational Trojans use a set of multiple AND gates that are wired to a set of benign wires on a chip. When this happens, it creates a rare logic condition such that the Trojan is only triggered when a perfect combination of input wires happen. Similarly, sequential Trojans take this concept but apply them to state machines. This allows a Trojan to sense multiple events that must happen in a row before it triggers an activation. It allows the Trojan to have better control over when to activate the payload over combinational Trojans. Hardware Trojans might also attempt to detect *analog* events that are happening in a chip as well. For example, a hardware Trojan might activate if a temperature sensor hits a high temperature, making it fail in an important scenario. Other examples include voltage and even aging effects on a chip, which can make for an effective long-term “time bomb” [3, 5].

The payload is the malicious action(s) taken by the Trojan after the trigger. The most simple type of Trojans are *functional*. As the name states, they simply change the logic or memory of a circuit by flipping a set number of bits to create a desired outcome. Even though it is simple, it allows for effective altering of an IC that may affect critical functionality. *Parametric* Trojans are analog as functional Trojans are to digital. They change power a component is taking, increase delay, or reduce the reliability of a chip in an attempt to hurt the usefulness of the chip. *Side-Channel Leakage* Trojans find a way to exfiltrate sensitive data from a chip through typically unreadable methods. Typically, changes in power or broadcasting over electromagnetic waves are the most common methods to leak using side-channels. *Denial-of-Service* Trojans, much like their software counterpart, will attempt to disable an important function of a chip. By doing so, it will make the chip useless or less-secure to other further attacks [3]. Figure 2 below illustrates the different forms of activation characteristics:

![[Pasted image 20240906142444.png]]

<center> <b> Figure 2 </b>: Different Hardware Trojan Activation Techniques Flowchart [2]</center>

When it comes to the current state of the art, research is focusing attempting to improve novel triggering mechanisms, using new types of payloads, and minimizing Trojan detectability.  For instance, a new triggering mechanism that has been discussed recently is the use of don’t care statements for logic blocks. In optimizing the amount of gates needed, a Trojan can take advantage of a system not caring about a certain input and place a Trojan between them, making it difficult to detect [5]. Also, as Trojans become more common, collusion between adversaries can lead to complex and stealthy attacks where a Trojan might be planned out over multiple stages of production, such as placing a Trojan in the design phase and further hiding and approving it in the fabrication stage [3].
## Case Studies

Both in literature and in the real-world, there have been case studies of hardware Trojans that have demonstrated their effectiveness and various uses across many different types of devices and scenarios. Specifically, over the past thirty years hardware Trojans have been found everywhere from everyday appliances to top secret military exploits [9]. The report will outline two main case studies with one being from literature and the other being found in the real-world. The first study delves into the possibility of using hardware Trojans to generate a ransomware attack. The second study details the hardware Trojan attack on Hezbollah’s military.’

### Hardware Ransomware: Are They Feasible?

When it comes to typical hardware Trojans, the payload often consists of a way to disrupt the original use-case of the chip to cause unexpected behavior, or to try and leak important information through the side-channels on a chip. Even though these are powerful in their own right, all of them rely on external monetary motivation for an attack to become a reality. Without any external source, a malicious actor will have no reason to place a hardware Trojan on a device unless it is for no monetary gain or for the hope that they gain confidential information that they can sell via a side-channel attack. Therefore, Dong *et al*, faculty and students at the Tallinn University of Technology, developed a new form of a Trojan called **hardware ransomware** [10]. 

As a reminder, typical software ransomware will encrypt a user’s data on a computer and request for payment to release the data. By using either social engineering or a software vulnerability, it allows for an attacker to effectively lock up thousands of systems and charge each user a considerable amount of money if they want their files back. In the past, there have been many ransomware outbreaks that were devastating for users and have affect the personal, commercial, military, and health industries gravely. The most famous example was the *WannaCry* string of ransomware that tore across multiple countries in 2017. On all Windows-based operating systems at the time, there was two purposeful exploits called *EternalBlue* and *DoublePulsar* that were mandated by the United States’ National Security Agency (NSA). However, it was leaked by a hacker group known as “The Shadow Brokers.” EternalBlue allowed for systems to secretly send each other messages through SMB without any confirmation by the user, and the DoublePulsar exploit allowed a backdoor to be placed so that the WannaCry ransomware can be injected later. In the end, an estimated 300,000 systems were affected in over 150 countries, with an estimated damages estimated to be around $4 billion [11-12].

The authors, as discussed previously, found that the globalized IC chain has had vulnerabilities that can be exploited and found how effective software ransoms can be. They hypothesized that ransomware can benefit from hardware-based attacks as it would make them harder to detect and remove. Their case study attempts to demonstrates that a hardware ransom attack can happen as it currently stands in the landscape of hardware Trojans With this as their motivation, the researchers set out to develop a hardware version of ransomware that can embed malicious logic onto an IC during the design stage or fabrication that will encrypt the data lines until a ransom is paid to the attacker. Specifically, the authors lay out three main components that would make up a hardware Trojan. Firstly, a SRAM or ring oscillator (RO) physical unclonable function (PUF) is placed on the chip to generate a unique key (`PRK_V`) based on the silicon differences between each. Unlike typical implementations of PUFs that are used for chip authentication to prevent bootlegs, this PUF is used to generate a unique key to be a base component for malicious encryption. It also contains a public-key cryptographic chip that is used to encrypt and decrypt a user’s data without their permission. In this study, the authors specifically went with a combination of the elliptical curve and Diffie-Hellman (ECDH Unit) to generate a shared secret for the encrypted user data. The authors created both a low-latency (LL-ECDH) and a low-area (LA-ECDH) variation that can be used depending if the area or the latency is the more problematic thing to solve. The third component consists of a control unit. A finite state machine (FSM) manages how the attack flows from one phase to another. Specifically, it deals with when the attack triggers, when the keys are generated, when the data is encrypted, and if the data is decrypted when the ransom is paid. Most importantly, it can be designed to use both internal (combinational/sequential) and external (side-channel) triggers [10]. The diagram below shows the basic hardware implementation:

![[Pasted image 20250409171934.png | center]]
<center> <b> Figure 3 </b>: Hardware Ransomware Layout [10]</center>

To test the design of the hardware ransomware, the authors decided to try three different test benches to evaluate them on: a fabricated 65nm CMOS ASIC, an FPGA implementation, and the common evaluation planform (CEP). For the ASIC, they decided to use an external trigger, an SRAM PUF, emulated the storage to save on costs, and had a debug module to ensure the attack worked. They found that the ransomware increased the SoC area by only 0.73%, consumed only 5.2 $\micro$W of power, and had no timing violations on the chip. This means that visual, timing, and power analysis will be difficult to attempt on the chip. When placed on the Xilinx Zynq FPGA, they found a resource utilization of 32% to 17% depending on if it used the less latency or less area variation of the ECDH. On the common evaluation platform (CEP), an open-source RISC-V based SoC, they inserted another Trojan to see if it is compatible with existing chips and see it’s effectiveness. After insertions, the authors found that there was only an area increase of 0.8%, a power utilization increase of 0.4%, and no performance degradation of the chip. The stealthiness and effectiveness of the chip is clear by their strenuous trials [10].

However, there are limitations when it comes to using hardware ransomware. Firstly, the stability of the PUFs can be an issue, as they could generate a different key depending on the age of the hardware, which breaks the Trojan. It is also more difficult to communicate to the user that they are being held for ransom. For example, with software ransom, they take advantage of pop-ups, loud audio files, and changing desktop wallpapers and icons to alert the user that they have been hacked. With a hardware Trojan, there is no obvious sign of infection until the chip stops working. The trigger also has to carefully go around verification and testing such that the timing or power is not skewed by it. However, it is clear that this type of attack can be deadly. With there being no fundamental barriers that prevent a real-world attack, hardware ransomware might be the next step attackers take in the future [10].

### The Pager Attacks in Lebanon

Moving from the literature into the real-world, the stakes get higher as the situation becomes more complicated. The pager attack on Hezbollah in Lebanon is one of the first known instance of a hardware Trojan being used in war. Tragically, this situation has led to dozens being murdered, including civilians and two children, as well as thousands of more left injured. For the sake of the study and its lessons related to hardware Trojans, the story behind how it happened and its repercussions will be discussed. Understand that this tragedy may discuss topics that might be a little heavy. That is the content warning.

Before getting into exactly what happened, the background behind the conflict between Hezbollah and the state of Israel must be explained. Hezbollah is a political party and military group that has been in Lebanon since the Lebanese Civil War, founded in 1985. During the war, they fought against Israel and other Western forces in an attempt to bring a Syrian-based government to power. With ties to Iran as well, the group has become enemies with Israel and other Western influences throughout the Middle East since the war ended. Throughout their existence, some countries, such as the United States, have considered them a terrorist organization as they have continued to clash with Israel at the border. With the beginning of the Israeli–Palestinian conflict in 2023, Hezbollah began to launch offensives against the Israel-Lebanon border in support of Hamas. In September 2024, Israel launched a large counterattack against them, leading led to the passing of longtime leader Hassan Nasrallah. Tensions continued to rise up to the day of the attack [13].

In 2023, Hezbollah chosen to switch over from it’s former type of communication ot pagers. Hezbollah like these pagers more than other means since they had a long battery life, were reliable, and could send encrypted messages over a low-frequency band that was hard to detect and decrypt  [14]. However, on September 17th, 2024, it seemed to be a regular day across the city of Beirut. However, according to the witnesses and the New York Times, a message was received on the pagers that appeared to be coming from Hezbollah’s leadership. Shortly after, smoke briefly started to release from the device until small explosions rang out from them all across the city. This scene continued for about an hour as hundreds were rushed to the hospital. A further set of attacks happened the day after on Wednesday. With some of the explosions happening close to a funeral being held for the victims of the previous attack, it was a terrifying time for those to be in the country [15].

After the attacks, investigations around the group who might have been responsible began to unfold. In the debris, two different models of pager have been found, the Icom IC-V82 and the Gold Apollo AR-924. The former was made by a Japanese company and exported to the Middle East for a decade from 2004 to 2014. Since then, the company has stop producing the model and its batteries. In a release, the company says that they only ship the devices directly from Icom or a verified distributor. Further investigate found that those devices might have been a knock-off product which had been moved from Hezbollah into Lebanon around five months prior. The second pager is much more interesting. The Gold Apollo brand goes back to a Taiwanese manufacturer, which similarly denied the claims of being involved. However, after some more digging, the founder admitted that he had a deal with a Hungarian-based company, BAC, to create the devices under his name. However, the CEO of BAC had heard nothing about this deal, citing that they do not make pagers at all with the Hungarian government saying that the company did not manufacture *anything* within the country. Eventually, it was revealed that the US forces and Israel designed the attack together [13]. Shortly afterwards, the experts at the UN Human Rights commission condemned the attacks as they are under the violation of multiple international laws. Specifically, they state that the attack is a violation of the human right to life as the victims did not pose any imminent lethal threat to anyone at the time. It also violated the international humanitarian law, as the attack did not properly isolate targets as civilians could have been near the victims during the attack. Additionally, it is considered a war crime of murder, attacking civilians, an indiscriminate attack, and prohibited booby-traps [16].

Even though it was initially unknown what the attacks were caused by, it was eventually realized it was caused by a hardware Trojan rather than a software threat. Israeli officials behind the attack to uncovered that the Trojan communication devices were given to Lebanon as far back as 2015. Within the radios, they found a larger battery packs than normal, a hidden explosive, and even a transmission system that allowed for full eavesdropping of Hezbollah’s communications to the Israeli government. These radios account for the Icom radios. They revealed that the trigger was both a combination of the message being received and opening the message, where the user needs to use both of their hands to hit both buttons on the device. This would then trigger the payload, which was the batteries to catch fire, causing the hidden explosive disguised as a motherboard crystal to catch fire and explode [17]. This payload-based attack and side-channel leakage hardware Trojan shook the world. It sets a dangerous precedent that hardware-based attacks can be used for war purposes. Being so difficult to detect and hard to target non-civilians, hardware Trojans should never been used to harm a human in anyway.

## Existing Detection/Prevention Techniques

Due to the dangerous nature of hardware Trojans, IC chip manufactures must attempt to uphold **IC Trust**, which makes sure that a fabricated chip/system will carry out only the desired function the chip was made for and nothing more. Upholding this principle to be paramount allows for IC creators since it following this rule can prevent most hardware Trojan attacks from ever happening. There are a few challenges related to IC Trust, however. There are often millions of gates in an IC, Trojans are hard to activate or trigger, difficult to model outside of real cases, and conventional IC testing and validation often fails to reliably detect hardware Trojans [2]. Therefore, researchers have developed special methods of Trojan detection and prevention to try to stop attacks both before and after the Trojan has been placed. 

The most common form of hardware Trojan detection primarily focuses on detection. This countermeasure can hold two different characteristics. Firstly, it can either focus on the attack before it is fabricated (*presilicon*) and afterwards (*postsilicon*) [5]. On top of that, it can focus on either non-destructive or destructive methods. Focusing on presilicon methods, functional testing utilizes a statistical approach to try and narrow down the feasible space a Trojan can be found and test all the suspicious areas. In particular, there is a method known as the MERO method that tests for a rare event in a circuit by generating vectors that trigger a set of rarely-activated signals many times. This gives a high confidence that an unknown Trojan is detected, especially if it relies on digital triggers [8]. Code analysis and formal verification can also be done by humans, but typically relies on human interaction and can be time consuming and costly [5]. Because of this, postsilicon is typically the go-to method. 

Postsilicon focuses on detection techniques where a chip is studied to find any possible Trojans within. In destructive methods, a suspected chip has it’s layers removed one-by-one. By doing so, an image is able to be taken at each layer using an electron microscope to identify transistors, gates, and routing elements. Reverse engineering is then applied to either compare it to a golden chip, a perfect chip that does not have a Trojan in it, or reverse the functionality to find any suspicious parts within the chip. For example, the SPARTA method has been described in literature that compares images of a chip in both functional mode and scan mode using machine learning in order to find malicious flip-flops that may be excluded from the scan chain. This extra flip-flops are often a clear sign that a hardware Trojan or at minimum a design mistake exists within the IC [15]. Even though postsilicon more straight-forward and easier than presilicon approaches, it also often requires that both a gold-standard chip and the malicious chip have to both be destroyed, which might not be available depending on the situation [2, 3, 5] .

There are also a few methods that relate to the prevention of hardware Trojans that fall under the umbrella of **design for security (DfS)**. Also known as design-for-trust, these methods focus on how a designer can attempt to prevent a hardware Trojan being placed on an IC by using clever methods to make it more difficult. Obfuscating the rare trigger space can make it so that a Trojan designer cannot find a rare event to place it’s trigger on. The scan-chain can also be modified such that rare-trigger nets do not even exist in the design. Layout filling makes it so that there is no empty space left on an IC, so a Trojan cannot be placed on an empty cell. There is also a proposed method that places on-chip monitors that can help improve detection later down the line [3, 5]. 

There also has been discussion of using machine learning to improve the accuracy of all these methods. Specifically, machine learning has found to improve reverse engineering techniques, detect hardware Trojans in real-time on network-based chips, remove the need for a golden chip by observing metrics of a netlist, analyze chips on the gate-level, and be able to classify chips into either defective or benign based on a set of inputs [16]. 

Most importantly, almost everyone of these detection/prevention techniques are mutually exclusive. They can be used in conjunction with each other to create a hybrid solutions that can reduce attack vectors and easily detect a Trojan if it makes it through. With so many techniques in the literature today, there are a staggering number of combinations that a chip designer can use to prevent hardware Trojan attacks. When choosing a solution, however, the monetary and cost of time must be considered depending on the situation. For instance, a consumer-grade chip might use very minimal hardware Trojan prevention, while a professional/military grade chip should place utmost importance in having as many prevention methods as possible in order to hold military and company information security paramount.
## Proposed Approach

Current hardware Trojan detection methods face fundamental limitations: They are either reactive, destructive, or computationally intensive. I propose a Dynamic Netlist Randomization (DNR) methodology that prevents combinational Trojans from ever activating, rather than attempting to detect them after fabrication. The core innovation lies in dynamically altering the very logic paths that Trojans depend on for activation, rendering their carefully designed trigger conditions statistically irrelevant during operation.

DNR utilizes three different components together to randomize the netlists. First, a lightweight reconfigurable logic layer integrated during the design phase enables runtime modification of non-critical combinational paths [2]. This isn't full FPGA programmability, but rather strategic minimal reconfiguration points that permute gate structures just enough to break static trigger dependencies. Second, a noise injection into normally quiescent control signals prevents Trojans from relying on predictable signal stability [5]. Third, an efficient consistency verification unit maintains functional correctness despite these dynamic modifications, creating a security envelope without compromising core operations [4].

The security advantages emerge from how DNR fundamentally changes the attacker's calculus. Traditional combinational Trojans exploit fixed rare conditions, such as specific AND-OR sequence occurring only once every million cycles. By randomizing the underlying gate relationships periodically, it ensures no trigger condition remains stable long enough to activate. Even if a Trojan exists physically in the silicon, it becomes functionally inert.
## Conclusion

Hardware Trojans are a growing threat in our globally distributed semiconductor supply chain. These stealthy modifications—triggered by rare events or external conditions—can disable systems, leak data, or even cause physical destruction, as seen in attacks like the Lebanon pager bombings. Current defenses, including presilicon testing and postsilicon imaging, are limited by their reactive or destructive nature. Prevention techniques like obfuscation and layout filling help but are not foolproof. Machine learning shows promise but faces scalability challenges. The proposed **Dynamic Netlist Randomization (DNR)** offers a proactive solution by disrupting Trojan triggers at runtime. However, long-term security requires a **multi-layered approach**: stricter supply-chain controls, hybrid detection methods, and advancements in trusted fabrication. As hardware underpins everything from consumer devices to military systems, securing it is no longer optional—it’s a **global imperative**. The industry must act now to prevent the next hardware Trojan from causing irreversible harm.
