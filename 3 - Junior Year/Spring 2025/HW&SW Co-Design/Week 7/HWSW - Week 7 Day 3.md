# IoT Devices

## What is IoT?

```ad-summary
title: Defintiion
**The Internet of Things (IoTs)** represents the network of physical objects "things" that are embedded with sensors, software, electronics, and other technologies to connect and exchange data with other devices and systems over the internet.
```

## History of IoT

- 1970 - The actual idea of connected devices was proposed
- 1990 - John Romkey created a toaster which could be turned on/off over the Internet
- 1995 - Siemens introduced the first cellular module built for M2M
- 2005 - International Telecommunications Union (ITU) published its first report
- 2008 - The Internet of Things was born
- 2011 - Gartner, the market research company, included “The Internet of Things” technology in their research”

## How IoT Works?

**Sensor**: Sensors or devices are a key component that helps you to collect live data from the surrounding environment

**Connectivity**: All the collected data is sent to a cloud infrastructure.

**Data Processing:** Once that data is collected, and it gets to the cloud, the software performs processing on the gathered data.

**User Interface**: The information needs to be available to the end-user
