# Operating Systems

## Need for an Operating System

Many applications are complex enough that writing one program does not suffice. When multiple operations must be performed at widely varying times, a single program can easily become complex
- There are a bunch of different sensors that need to be read that ALL are used to create decisions
- Writing a single program to do this is nearly impossible and will get messy FAST

**Process**: Clearly defined the state of the executing program

**Operating System**: The mechanism for switching the execution between processes

```ad-warning
One weakness of operating systems is that they do not have timing guarantees.
- If a time constraint is placed on an operating system, you are going towards real-time operating systems.
```

**Real-Time Operating System**: An operating system that can meet timing requirements.
