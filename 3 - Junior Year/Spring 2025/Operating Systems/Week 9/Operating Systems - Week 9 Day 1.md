# Concurrency Day 2

## Software Support for Mutual Exclusion: Semaphores

Access to critical resources are stored in a variable `s`

We need two basic messages to send to `s`:
1. A resource is ready: `semSignal(s)`
2. I want to use a resource `semWait(s)`

```ad-note
- `semWait(s)` will either give the resource or get blocked if the resource is in use
- Both funcitons are atomic
- Implementations differ widely depending on the situation
```

### How Do Semaphores Work?

**Three operations** that can be enacted on `s` are:
1. A semaphore may be initialized to a nonnegative integer value
2. The `semWait` operation decrements the smaphore value
3. The `semSignal` operation increments the semaphore value

```ad-note
There is no way to inspect or manipulate semaphores other than these three values
```

### Semaphore Metaphor

### Semaphore Primitives Definition

```c++
struct semaphore {
	int count;
	queueType queue;
}

void semWait(semaphore s) {
	s.count--;
	if (s.coun < 0) {
		// Place this process in s.queue
		// Block this process
	}
}

void semSignal(semaphore s) {
	s.count++;
	if (s.count <= 0) {
		// Remove a process P from s.queue
		// Place process P on the ready list
	}
}
```

### Types of Semaphores

A queue is used to hold process waiting on the semaphore

**Strong Semaphores**: The process that has been blocked the longest is released from the queue first (FIFO)

**Weak Semaphores**: The order in which processes are removed from the queue is not specified 

#### Strong Semaphore Example

#comebacklater 

We have four processes: $A, B, C, D$

Let's say $D$ sends messages $A$, $B$, and $C$
- $s=n$ means taht $n$ messages from $D$ is ready to read

Starting:
- $A$ is running $B, C, D$ are ready
- $s = 1$

$A$ issues a `semWait(s)` in order to send itâ€™s message to $D$

Next, $b$ tries to access ouptut from $D$, but
