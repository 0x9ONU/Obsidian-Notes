# Interrupts 

### Definition

```ad-summary
title: Definition
Mechanism by which other modules may interrupt the normal sequencing of the processor
```

**Provided to improve processor utilization**:
- Most I/O devices are slower than the processor
- Processor must pause to wait for device
- This is a *wasteful* use of the processor without any interrupts


| Class            | Summary                                                                                                                                                                                                                                 |
| ---------------- | --------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------- |
| Program          | Generated by some condition that occurs as a result of an instruction execution:<br><br>arithmetic overflow<br>division by zero<br>attempt to execute an illegal machine instruciton<br>reference outside a userâ€™s allowed memory space |
| Timer            | Generated bya  timer within the processor. This allows the operating system o perform certain functions on a regular basis.                                                                                                             |
| I/O              | Generated by an I/O Controller tos ignal normal completion of an operation or to signal a variety of error conditions.                                                                                                                  |
| Hardware Failure | Generated by a a failure, such as power failure or memory parity error.                                                                                                                                                                 |

## Flow of Control

### Without Interrupts

```ad-warning
With no interrupts, a less-important process might take over the CPU for a long time, which is poor CPU usage and can be dangerous in other cases. In the case of I/O taking awhile, it essentially freezes the CPU until it is done.
```

### With Interrupts

## Improved Instruction Cycle

```ad-note
There is more overhead with this instruciton cycle, but it saves the CPU from a lot of downtime, so it is worth it
```

## Simple Interrupt Processing

## Handling Multiple Interrupts

Comes down to a *two different methods*
1. Disable interrupts while an interrupt is being processed
2. Define priorities for interrupts

**Sequential Interrupts**

**Nested Interrupts with Priorities**
