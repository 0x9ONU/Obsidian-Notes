- Apollo 13: The Successful Failure

```

# Apollo 13

## Quick History of Spaceflight

1. **First Manned Spaceflight**: Vostok1, April 12, 1961 (Yuri Gagarin)
2. **First Docking in Space**: Gemini VIII with Agena target, March 16, 1966 (Neil Armstrong & David Scott)
3. **First Manned Flight to Moon**: Apollo 8, December 21-27, 1968 (Borman, Lovell, Anders)
4. **First Man on Moon**: Apollo 11, July 20, 1969 (Landed: Armstrong & Aldrin; CMP: Collins)

## Basic Information

```ad-summary
- Launched April 11th, 1970
- Commander: James A. Lovell Jr.
- Command Module Pilot: John L. Swigert Jr.
```

## What Happened?

Wire insulation inside an oxygen tank damaged during *ground testing*
- Tank later installed in Apollo 13 Service Module (SM)
- Routine stir of the liquid oxygen ignited the damaged wire insulation inside tank
- Resultant explosion vented the contents of both of the SM’s oxygen tanks to space

```

## Concept of Risk

```
"This just isn't a contingency we've remotely looked at"
```

Is space flight risky? Can you predict all possible risks?

## Concepts of Agile Software Development

```ad-summary
We are uncovering better ways of develping software byd oing it and helping other do it. Thorugh this work, we have come to value:

- Individuals and interactions over processes and tools
- Working software
- Customer collaboration
- **Responding to Change**
```

It is critical to understand how to *respond* to failure as much as it is to *prevent* it.

## User Story

```ad-summary
title: Definition
An informal, natural language description of features of a product/software system
```

It is written from the *perspective of an end user* or user of a product or system

```ad-important
Helps the design group better understand the needs of the user
- Helps get "into the shoes" of the user
```

### A Good User Story Addresses…

- **Who** wants the functionality 
- **What** it is they need
- **Why** they want it

```ad-example
"As an MS Word power user, I need a spell checker so that I don't have to worry about spelling mistakes"
```

### Acceptance Criteria

```ad-summary
title: Definition
The conditions that must be satisifed for a product, user story, or increment of work to be acepted. 
```

## Did the Contraption Work?

**Yes!!**: However, there were still other problems to solve:
- Modifying the spacecraft’s trajectory so that it does not burn up in the Earth’s atmosphere
- Come in too flat and bounce off the atmosphere and fly endlessly into space

```ad-question
How does NASA prioritize what to work on first?
```

They prioritized the return to Earth rather than actually making it to the moon once the problems started to happen.

# Today’s Take-Away

It is possible that you might have a project that:
- Must quickly adapt to changes in requirements
- Requires prioritization of tasks
- Must deal with unlooked-for impediments
