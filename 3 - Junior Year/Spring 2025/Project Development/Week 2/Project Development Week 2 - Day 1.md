# Project Management

## Introduction

```ad-summary
title: Definition
Th process of planning, executing, and monitoring a project to ensure its successful compleiton. It involves setting objectives, determining the reosurces needed, and assigning tasks to individuals or teams.
```

**Two main types**:
1. *Traditional*: More linear approach
2. *Agile*: More flexible and adaptable

## What is the Process?

According to the PMBOK Guide (Project Management Body of Knowledge) by the *Project Management Institute (PMI)*, a project management life cycle consists of **five distinct phases** that combine to run a project idea into a working product:

1. Initiation:
	- Define project goals
	- Create a business case
	- Complete the project charter
	- Identify stakeholders
2. Planning
	- Scope planning and definition
	- Create a project plan
	- Set a budget baseline
	- Define roles and responsibilities
	- Risk analysis
3. Executing
	- Allocate project resources
	- Manage project resources
	- Build the project or process
	- Meet often and fix issues as they arise
	- Quality assurance
4. Controlling
	- Track effort and cost
	- Monitor project progress
	- Ensure adherence to plan
	- Prevent any chance for distruptions
	- Performance reporting
	- Risk monitoring
	- Scope verification
5. Start-up/Close-Out
	- Provide the function/product to the client

## MPMP
### Decision Points

At the first 3 decision points, the decision makers working with the project team Review the Decision Support Package (DSP) and choose one of the following options:
1. Advance/Fund the project
2. Cancel or suspend the project based on it’s merits
3. Recycle the phase 9if warranted) based on new information  or altered business objectives.

```ad-warning
You might get grilled during these reviews, but it is meant to make you think like an engineer
```

### Influence Curve

```ad-important
A dedicated substantial *early* effort defines project objectives and epxlores a wide variety of viable project options
```

### Nine Knowledge Areas

```ad-note
MPMP folllows the PMBOK
```

1. Integration
2. Scope
3. Time 
4. Cost
5. HES
6. etc.

## Project Management Triangle

![[Quality-triangle 1.png]]

**For Academic Projects**:
1. *Time*: Fixed upper bound → Like a brick
2. *Cost*: $f(team \space size, credit \space hours)$ → Elastic, like a rubber band but it can break
3. *Scope*: $Domain:(Student \space Work)$ → Like Silly Putty, it can keep on stretching and break

```ad-important
Be aware of scope creep. Do not overpromise as it can break the triangle's balance.
```
