# Project Documentation

## Purpose of Documentation

**Knowledge Transfer**:
- Documentation serves as a repository of knowledge
- Allowing for the seamless transfer of information
- Solidifies agreements between team members. 
- It ensures that critical insights and procedures are not lost when individuals transition in or out of a project.

**Clarity and Understanding**:
- Well-documented projects foster better comprehension
- Clear and concise documentation helps team members and stakeholders understand:
	- Objectives
	- Requirements
	- Processes
- Reduces the likelihood of misunderstandings.

**Troubleshooting and Debugging**:
- In the event of issues or errors, documentation serves as a troubleshooting guide
- Detailed logs, error messages, and resolution steps can *significantly expedite* the debugging process and minimizes downtime.

**Compliance and Auditing**:
- Documentation is essential for compliance with industry standards and regulations.
- It provides a trail of actions taken, decisions made, and changes implemented
- Facilitates audits and ensures that the project aligns with legal and regulatory requirements

**Facilitating Collaboration**
- Effective collaboration is built on shared understanding
- Documentation enhances collaboration by providing a common reference point for all team members
- This ensures that everyone is on the same page, working towards the same goals.

## Physical Log Books

Engineers use physical logbooks to document and record their work, from thoughts, design ideas, calculations and sketches, through to literature readings and lab results
- Permanent record of your work
- Helps them plan for future projects
- Reflect on past decisions, achievements, and lessons learned.

It can also:
- Serves as a personal/professional reference about project learning and results
- Helps with tracking one’s daily work
- Mitigates the cost of context switching.
- Allows you to reflect on your work
- Gets you more engaged in meetings

```ad-important
**Everything** goes into your log book
- Begins when you start thinking about problems to solve
- Write down everything you know about these problems and why you want to solve them.
- Then write down, draw, sketch, glue, or tape in every step of your process between this first step and your final solution
```

```ad-example
- Notes on background research
- Interviews with users or experts
- Drawings and sketches
- Photos of competing products
- Lists of design requirements
- Questions/issues you face
```

*To use it effectively, you must*:
- Consider the problem you’re attempting to solve
- Describe your method for solving it
- Describe the process of carrying out the method
- Record what happened, and ask how it could be improved

**Pomodoro Technique**: Uses a kitchen timer to break work into intervals, typically 25 minutes in length, separated by short breaks
1. Decide on the task to be done
2. Set the timer (typically for 25 minutes)
3. Work on the task
4. End work when the timer rings and take a short break (typically 5 to 10 minutes).
5. Go back to step 2 and repat until you complete four Pomodoro.
6. After four Pomodoros are done, take a long break (typically 20-30 minutes)

**Expectations**:
- 5-6 pages throughout the week
