# Leadership

## Ernest Shackleton (1874-1922)

One of the principal explorers of the time. Tried to be the first to get to the South Pole

Went on the **Nimrod Expedition**:
- Planned to cover 1,720 miles in 91 days. Ration cuts happened multiple times to extend journey. Eventually below half of the 6k calories they needed a day
- Achieved Polar Plateau (9,500 ft. elevation)
- Decided that it was high enough and went back down and barely made it back alive.

*Aftermath*:
- When asked by his wife about turning back only 97 miles from the Pole: “I thought you’d rather have a live donkey than a dead lion."”
- Got beat by two other exploration groups to the pole

### His **1914 Goal**

Achieve the first land crossing of the Antarctic continent
- Start from the Weddell Sea
- Cross over the South Pole
- Finish at the Ross Sea

```ad-warning
Challenges:
- Harsh weather
- Treacherous terrain
- Unknown terrain
- Limited supplies
```

Their ship hit the ice in the middle of the coean and change their goals from making it across the continent to *surviving*.
- Got what they could from the ship and started their walk back.
- They got to Elephant Island a while later
- Had very few food sources, but they were barely making it along

They had **three choices** to make it back:
1. Port Stanley in the Falkland Island (660 mi)
	- Against the wind
	- But had civilization
2. Deception Island (230 mi)
	- Uninhabited, but closest
3. South Georgia Island (810 mi)
	- Small wailing station
	- Farthest, but had the wind behind them

Ended up going to South Georgia Island to get a rescue party, and got the rest of the crew off the island just before the winter started to hit.

### Studying His Leadership

1. Models and Inspires Optimism
- Against all odds, he always seemed hopeful

2. Develop a clear, shared purpose

3. Building Unity and Commitment within the Team
- Must try to work towards the common purpose for the success of all

4. Create a plan, an alternate plan, and be flexible

5. Make the Tough Decisions

## Critical Points $\star$

1. Without carefully considering which challenge to tackle, and specifically articulating your final decision, you will not know where to start your design process nor be able to determine whether you successfully finished the design.
2. Once the motivation is clearly defined, we must specify what it is we are going to do about it.
3. A clear goal is necessary to weigh all future design decisions against.

```ad-important
We must understand the *problem* before the appropriate **solution** can be designed.
```

## Problem Statement

```ad-summary
A concise and concrete summary of the problem you seek to address
```

Helps contextualize the significance of your problem by:
- Describing what we already know
- Specifying what we aim to address
- Explains why further investigation is necessary

Should include:
- User’s needs
- Design constraints
- Desired outcomes

*Unfortunately* real world problems are:
1. Ill-defined
2. Imprecisely communicated
3. Not well-thought out
4. Sometimes changing

```ad-example
Google Glass and Segways were:
- Groundbreaking
- Applications of cutting-edge technology
- *Solutions that are in search of a problem*
```

## Problem Framing

```ad-summary
title: Definition
A proccess for analyzing, understanding, and ultimately defining a problem or challenge in order to develop an effective solution.
```

You must view from multiple perspectives much like how a photographer “frames” each photo they take.

### Why Problem Framing?

1. Provides Clarity
2. Narrows Scope
3. Achieves alignment
4. Increases Efficiency

```ad-important
Good designa nd effective iteration can help improve a product, but they won't tell you if you're addressing the right problem.
```

### Reframing

Can be used to find unexpected solutions that cannot be seen otherwise

### How to Frame a Problem

1. **Examine the Problem**: Prioritize the user(s) and the purpose(s) they desire to accomplish.
2. **User Research**: Used to uncovering deep-rooted desires in the public
3. **User Interviews or Desktop Research**: Can reveal insights into potential users and what problems they face. (Ex. *Competitive Analysis*)
