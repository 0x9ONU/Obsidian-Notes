# Meetings

## Things That Meetings Provide

### Number 1: A Meeting Defines the Team

- IN some jobs the leader does guide his team through his personal experience
- In typical corporate environments, the daily or weekly meeting is often the only time when the leader is ever perceived to be guiding a team rather than doing a job.

### Number 2: A Meeting Pools Knowledge

- Every group creates its own *pool* of shared knowledge, experience, judgment, and folklore.
- The pool consists only of what the individuals have experienced or discussed as a group

```ad-example
Those tings that every individual knows that all the others know, too
```

- A meeting is the place where the group revises, updates, and adds to the current project knowledge

```ad-important
title: Knowledge Pools Leverage Efficiencies
The special nuances and their implications provided in a statement are immediately clear to all members
- An enormous amount of material can be left unsaid that would have to be made *explicit to an outsider*
```

The pool helps all members to:
1. Do their jobs more intelligently
2. Greatly increase the speed and efficiency of all internal communications

Pools need constant refreshing and replenishing, and occasionally the removal of impurities.
- Exchanging information and ideas that members have acquired separately or in smaller groups since the last meeting is an important contribution to the strength of the group.
- By questioning and commenting on new contributions, the group performs an important “filtration” process that extracts what’s valuable and discards the rest

**The Social Mind**:
- Some ethologists call the capacity to share knowledge and expierence among a group “the social mind”, conceviing it as a single mind disperesed among a number of people with a special creative power
- A group of people meeting together can often produce better ideas, plans, and decisions than can a single individual, or a number of individuals, each working alone.  
- The meeting can of course also produce *worse outputs* or none at all, if it is a bad meeting.

### Number Three: A Meeting Focuses Efforts

A meeting helps every individual understand both the collective aim of the group and the way in which his own and eveyrone else’s work can contribute to the group’s success
- Take notes
- Avoid distractions
- Ask questions
- Prepare yourself mentally and physically
- Record your meeting

### Number Four: A Meeting Builds Commitment

- A meeting creates in all present a commitment to the decisions it makes and the objectives it pursues
- Once something has been decided, your membership in the group entails an obligation to accept the decision.
- For most people on most issues, it is enough to know that their alternative views were heard and considered.

## Kinds of Meetings

**Daily Meeting**: People work together on the same project with a common objective and reach decisions informally by general agreement

```ad-example
The *Daily Scrum* is a short dialy meeting designed to let the team plan out its work for the day and dientify any obstacles that could impact that work
```

```ad-note
*Standups*: Teams can hold a short daily meeting standing up to keep them shrot and focused
```

**Weekly Meeting**: Where members report on project progress to their supervisors
- Consists of a weekly report sent prior to the meeting that includes:
	- Prior week’s activities
	- Problems encountered
	- Next week’s plans
- Actual meeting (~30 minutes)

```ad-note
Your advisor is similar to a manager, having multiple "projects" to deal with along with many other items on their plate.
```

**Irregular Meeting**: Composed of people whose normal work does not bring them into contact and whose work has little or no relationship to the others’.
- *Project Review Board*: Three meetings held throughout the year to review your team’s progress
- Provides external feedback from non-advisors
- Board make-up:
	- 3-4 faculty members from ECCS/ME
	- 1-3 external reviewers
		- Working alumni
		- Retired alumni
		- Retired faculty
		- Local IEEE members

## Holding Effective Meetings

### Come Prepared

- If there is a document that is to be discussed, everyone should have read it prior to the meeting.
- If there is a data set to look at, everyone should have reviewed it prior to the meeting

```ad-example
If the "homeowrk" has not happened befor eht meeting, it will be difficult to hold
```

### Tech Check

- *What it is*: Verifying that all necessary technology works **before** the meeting starts
- *Why is it important*: Avoids delays and maintains a professional atmosphere.
- Step 1: Test all technology, including conference links and presentation tools, before the meeting
- Step 2: Have a backup plan for technological failures to prevent meeting disruption.
