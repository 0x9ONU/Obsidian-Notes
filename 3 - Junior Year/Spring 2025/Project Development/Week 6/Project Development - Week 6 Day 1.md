# Communication & Connections

```ad-quote
Effective communciaiton is essential for the success of any engineering project, as it allows us to cllaborate effectivley with others and ensure that our message is understood
```

## Reasons to Care

1. **Running an Efficient Meetings**:
	- Companies host an average of *61 meetings* per month
	- 39% of people sleep through them
	- 73% do other work during these meetings
2. **Working with Non-Engineers**
	- Upper management
	- Customers
	- Marketing/Sales
	- General Public
	- *Need to be able to clearly convey ideas to different groups*
3. **Working with Other Cultures**:
	- Be aware of expectations when working with people from other cultures.
		- *Example*: Beginning a meeting by exchanging pleasantries instead of jumping into the agenda
	- Avoid using slang, idioms, or phrases
	- Be aware of different approaches to time across cultures
	- Pay attention to body language
4. **Sharing Ideas**
	- Solving problems requires sharing ideas through:
		- Oral presentations
		- Technical reports
		- Avoiding jargon
	- It is easier for people to digest what you are saying if you make it clear and to the point instead of using a lot of technical jargon.
5. **Sending Emails**
	- Make sure your subject is relevant.
	- Keep it short and to the point
	- Remember your email could get forwarded to someone else so keep it professional
	- Do not use slang in emails as you would in text, again keep it professional.
	- If you have an issue with something someone sent to you, do not respond with a nasty email back. It is better to pick up the phone and call to resolve.

### Example: Big Picture to Upper Management

```ad-warning
Typically, you only get 30 seconds to get their attention, and around 5 minutes to give a presentation.
```

**Issues, Impact, Recommendation Method**:
1. Start the discussion by defining the *issue*. What is the problem you are trying to solve or the purpose for the meeting?
2. Next, is the *impact*, which is why upper management should care about the issue.
3. Finally, is the *recommendation*, which details the actions you think should be taken next to resolve the issue. *Key Component*: it shows you have thought about the issue as well.

```ad-note
Also helpful to provide a one page slide detailing the method. Can help visual learners and can be used to create take aways
```

## Curse of Knowledge Bias

When you know a concept well, you forget what it’s like to not know it. This affects the way you communicate, instruct, and teach it to others.
- Engineers use tons of words that now play like a “song” in their head. Any they overestimate how much other people can guess that “song”.

### Example: Song Game

Played a song out of a list of the top 120 songs only be tapping their fingers on a table.

On average, they predict that half of the people would be able to guess the song correctly

```ad-important
However, when the experiment played out, only 2.5% of the listeners correclty identified the song.
```

## Thinking and Speaking Abstractly

Through experience, certain words are packed with a lot of meaning
- An engineer often forgets that they were once a newbie and had to learn all those terms, sometime long ago…

Eventually one starts speaking abstractly, using code, as a member of the “in-group”:
- If you’re hanging out with other members of the in-group, not a problem
- However, if not, they might not understand the *jargon*

If a topic is too abstract, two people can interpret that topic differently:
- Greater the difference in backgrounds

### Avoid Abstract, Direct the Conversation

If someone starts to float upwards into abstraction, bring them back down to earth by asking them and using analogies. Use real-life examples. Make the idea come alive.

## How to Make Things “Stick”

1. Simplicity
2. Unexpectedness
3. Concreteness
4. Credibility
5. Emotional
6. Stories
