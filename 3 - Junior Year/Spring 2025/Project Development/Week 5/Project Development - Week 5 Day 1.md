# Modes of Failure

## Adam Grant on Failure

```ad-summary
He is an *organizational psychologist*:
- Specializes in how people find motivation and meaning in their work
```

The right response to failure is **NOT** to point fingers. It is to *draw lessons* from the failure.

The goal of debriefing is not to find villains to blame. It is to identify *habits to change*.

Learning is **not** about dwelling on the **past**. It’s about adapting in the *present* and improving for the *future*. 

## Embracing Failure

**Not all failures are created equal**:
- Some failures are “smarter” than others as they point the way to eventual success.

### The Fear of Failure

```ad-summary
Our brains are wired ot avoid accepting failure
```

## Basic Failures

- Simple, identifiable causes
- Preventable through forethought and discipline
- Occur when deviating from a proven process
	- Eliminate through training and quality control

```ad-example
- Deploying a software revision without testing
- Not double-checking data prior to a presentation
```

## Complex Failures

- Messier
- Involve multiple factors
- Often emerge from unpredictable, high-stakes situations

## Intelligent Failures

Preferably encountered through *experiments*:
- Usually occurs when you test an informed prediction, but the outcome doesn’t go as planned.

**Valuable because**:
- Generate data
- Inform new hypotheses
- Pave the way for future breakthroughs

### Four Factors to Categorize

1. **Experimenting in New Territory**:
	- Have a desired goal that requires breaking new grounds
	- Can’t Google the solution
2. **Credible Opportunity for Advancement**
	- Have a testing plan in place
	- Reward (if successful) is worth the risk
		- Not wasting time and resources
		- New knowledge allows for further advances
	- Never experiment?
3. **Hypothesis-Driven**
	- Actions being taken base don a reasonable expectation of success
	- Not engaging in random action
4. **Risk Are Minimized**
	- Don’t fail any more than necessary
	- Buy your new knowledge at the lowest price possible
