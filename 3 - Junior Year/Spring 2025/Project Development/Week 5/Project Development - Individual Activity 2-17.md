# Assignment Overview

```ad-question
What has been your prior ONU experience regarding:
1. The dependability of team members?
2. The structure and clarity associated with *prior* projects (Maker, FOD2, etc.)?
```
# Dependability of Team Members

In the past, I have been able to rely on most of my teammates pretty reliably throughout my time here at ONU. There has been times where I have had to pick up the slack for someone else; however, they usually had a good reason and generally communicated their problems. There was a few times in Foundations of Design 1 where a student did the bare minimum and did not provide his fair share of work for the team. Considering a lot of us were new to properly communicating and having confrontational skills, the rest of the group just did some of his work for him and hid the fact that he was not putting in as many hours as the rest of us. Looking back, the team should have done something about it, but we have all learned to handle a conflict like that now.

# The Structure and Clarity

## FOD1

Foundations of Design 1, in my opinion, has a flawed structure and clarity system when it comes to team meetings. Unlike future classes, FOD1 does not provide the group with a proper way to make agendas and how to hold an effective meeting. Typically, it was more about getting $x$, $y$, and $z$ done but never focused on how to set goals to get to that point. The clarity of some of the projects were lackluster as well. We felt that some instructions were made intentionally vague, especially when it came to the final design review document, which would often make it difficult to know what the clients (the professors) are asking for.

## FOD2

Foundations 2 patched a lot of problems over FOD1 when it came to structure. With teams typically being larger, meeting for the whole semester, and plenty of resources being provided on how to make a proper project from start to finish, it felt that the class was much more organized to the point we could overcome our lack of seniority. For example, a great meeting minutes template, a gantt chart, and more were provided and greatly helped the team’s cohesivity. The only part where it lacked in focus came to the open-ended nature of the class. Since the main prompt revolved around a product of the team’s choice, it could lead to problems when it comes to each team having their own  direction and motivation towards reaching an end goal. The clarity felt much more laid out; however, especially when it came to the find project. The check-ups with the professors felt meaningful and could help clear up an confusion that happened over the past few weeks of the project. 

## Maker Engineering

Maker had both strengths and weaknesses when it came to it’s structure and clarity. For it’s structure, I would give it a similar score to how FOD2 did it. It gave a loose set of instructions with a common goal that pushed students towards getting a client and making something new. The class itself allotted three hours which allowed students to meet with each other for upwards of two hours if needed. Students could directly ask either the professor or the TA if they had any questions about the project or where they should go from there, which helped with the direction that they could take. The three design reviews throughout the semester also helped in combination with the more laid-back nature of the course (1 credit versus 3). The clarity was often the main downside as the PCB maker in the Maker Space can be just working at best and can often experience downtime for maintenance and other problems. This can confuse students as they might not get their boards back until a week after other students might get them, which could slow down the team’s progress immensely.
