# Applying the Constraint: Source Model

## Review

### Attributes

All engineering designs contain a set of attributes that are used to describe various parameters associated with the design
- Some attributes affect the design’s functionality, while others affect its marketability

### Specifications

Quantitive, measurable criteria and standards that the product is designed to satisfy that allow designers to:
- Access using modeling or simulation skills
- Measure once prototype and production versions are built
- Justify design decisions to management and clients

### Metric

A system of related measures that facilitates the quantification of some particular characteristic

Defines the way that an engineering requirement is measured
- NOT the implementation
- NOT how a need is met
- NOT whether a need is met
- Allows design options to be compared

#### Specifying Values

- At least $x$
- At most $x$
- Between $x$ and $y$
- Exactly $x$ (AVOID)
- A set of discrete values $x_1, x_2, x_3$, etc.

### Constraints

Constraints are those specifications upon which noticeable, realistic limitations have been placed on the metrics due to *externally-sourced influences*

## Constraint-Source Model (CSM) Hypotheses

By categorizing constraints such that the source of a constraint is also included, an engineering student can:
1. Examine each design attribute from the point of view of a stakeholder for that source area, thereby allowing for a greater perspective on how such attributes can constrain the design.
2. Gain an appreciation for the general education courses that provide these perspectives.

Constraints affecting design can be modeled as attributes derived from *four* possible classification areas:
1. Technically-Drive
2. Customer-Driven
3. Business-Driven
4. Society-Driven

### Technically-Driven

Applying technical fundamentals
- Math
- Science
- Engineering
	- Design verification
	- Design qualification
	- Design validation
	- Design standardization

### Customer-Driven

Good for cusotmer :)

### Business-Driven

Demonstrating business acumen by understanding:
- Basics of financial management
- Basics of organizational management

### Society-Driven

Demonstrating awareness of societal values by understanding:
1. How one’s work is connected to people throughout the world
2. How solutions to problems affect various groups, communities, etc.

## CSM Defintions

### 3b

Constraints have the effect of eliminating those designs that would fail, thereby allowing designers to focus on the subset of designs that *might succeed*

### Use in Design Process

Four sets of questions
- Each set derived form one of the four source areas
- Each quesiotn conerned witha  typical attribute from its soruce area
- Attributes may lead to constraints and/or metrics
- Not meant to cover all possible attributes
