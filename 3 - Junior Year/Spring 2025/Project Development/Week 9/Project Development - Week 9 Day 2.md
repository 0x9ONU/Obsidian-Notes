# Requirements and Specifications

```ad-important
title: Remember
We must understand the problem before the appropriate solution can be designed
```

## Goals and Objectives

**Goals:** Our desired results
- Single project might have multiple goals ranging in scope and feasibility
- Most goals are ambitious and achievable
- View as guiding principles that provide direction and focus
- Various tools available for creating realistic goals (SMART Goals)
- The general *long-term* outcomes you want to achieve

**Objectives**: Something toward which work is to be directed, a strategic position to be attained, a purpose to be achieved, a result to be obtained, a product to be produced, or a service to be performed.
- Describe the *how* of what you are doing
- Communicate deliverables clearly, from the project’s initiation to its end
- Objectives are the *short to mid-term* specific, measurable actions you take to help you achieve a goal.

### The Problem

```ad-warning
The two terms are commonly conflated because project goals often describe business objectives.
```

## Requirements and Specifications

**Requirement**: A condition or capability that is necessary to be present in a product, service, or result to satisfy a business need. *What* the product shall do:
- Functions it will perform
- How well these functions should perform

**Specification**: A precise statement of the needs to be satisfied and the essential characteristics that are required. *How* the product is built and how it works:
- The form it is made of (materials, dimensions, etc.)
- How it is implemented: design schematics, blue prints, etc.
- User experience, interface, etc.

### Requirement Types

1. **Functional Requirements**: What functions *need* to be done
2. **Performance Requirements**: How well the system needs to perform the functions
3. **Interface Requirements**: How the system has to connect with other systems
4. **Personnel Requirements**: The expected capabilities of those using the system 
### Requirement Characteristics

1. Clear and consistent
2. Correct
3. Feasible
4. Flexible
5. Unambiguous
6. Singular
7. Verifiable

### Common Problems with Requirements

- Writing implementations “how” instead of requirements “what”
- Using incorrect terms
- Using incorrect sentence structure or bad grammar
- Writing unverifiable requirements
- Requirements only written for “first-use”
- Over-specifying

### Requirement Verification

Every requirement must be verified to ensure that the proposed design actually satisfies the requirement by:
- Examination
- Test
- Demonstration
- Analysis

### Product Requirement Document

```ad-example
Like a cookbook!
```

A document that lists everything that goes into each requirements:
- *Ingredient List*:
	- Key features
	- Requirements
	- Objectives
	- Customer needs
	- Possible constraints
	- Dependencies
- *Measurements*: How much effort is needed to develop each feature
- *Step-By-Step Instructions*: Clear step-by-step process to follow by outlining which features should be developed firs and how they all interact with each other
- *Room for Creativity*: Allows for some flexibility to allow a project to be better if a new idea comes up
- *End Goal*

**Why?**:
- Details features and functionality
- Common reference point for all team members and stakeholders
- Provides
	- List of deliverables
	- Acceptance criteria
	- Release date
- Clarifies what is out of scope
- Details what the customer expects to receive

```ad-danger
Capstones typically fail due to **Scope Creep**
