# Conflict Resolution Role Playing Exercises

## Instructions

Two rounds of role-playing
- For one round, you will role-play a scenario
- For the other round, you will observe a role-play scenario

Cards distributed to role-players
- Each “deck” has a programmer, computer engineering, and electrical engineering card
- Each deck asl has cards for project manager, marketing rep, and intern

*Observers*: Fill out the online observation form during and after the scenario as appropriate

*Role-Players*: Fill out the online reflection AFTER the scenario concludes

## Observer Notes

An idea was brought to the table (a voice assistant):
- One person is in for it as long as it is able to be simple
- One person is against since it adds too much complexity, time-frame, and budget

The idea bringer introduces adding only simple voice commands:
- One person agrees and understands that the potential delays are worth it

“Dumb” assistant will be chosen over a “smart” assistant

Computing design changes:
- Going for a cheaper option to increase profit

Durability:
- be careful since children are near it
- Could be thrown/knocked down
- The microphone speaker setup should not change it

Conclusion:
- Increase computing power ceiling
- In the future, they can add the microphone/speaker to the system along with the voice assistant
- A version two could be release with these capabilities
