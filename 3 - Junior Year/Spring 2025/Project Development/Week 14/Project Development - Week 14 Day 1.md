# Team and Project Charters

## What’s the Difference?

*Both* charters play crucial roles in project management
- Team charter focuses on the team’s collaboration cross *multiple* projects
- Project character finds requirements of a *single* project

For capstone, the team is collaborating on a single project:
- So these terms are often used interchangeably… but the focus is on providing guidelines for the team members to operate under
- In capstone, project characters take the form of a proposal template

## Team Charter

Generally what a capstone group works on first:
- All team members contribute to creating the team charter
- A well-crafted team charter sets the team up for successful *collaboration*

### Purpose

Serves as a blueprint that guides the team throughout their project
- Outlines the why, what, and how of the team’s work within a project
- Provides clarity on the team’s objectives, roles, and resources
- Includes predetermined guidelines for *conflict resolution*
- Is updated as needed
	- Person joins/leaves the team
	- Project significantly changes

### Key Components

1. **Mission and Objectives**: State the purpose of your team and what you collectively seek to accomplish
2. **Roles and Responsibilities**: List team member roles and responsibilities so everyone can review the expectations of all team members
3. **Budget and Resources**: Develop procedure for determining budget and allocating resources; list rules for managing project finances
4. **Work Processes**: Specify step-by-step the design process the team will use; make sure that all team members understand this process
5. **Performance Assessment**: Explain how your team will measure project success subjectively and objectively
6. **Communication Norms**: Identify how and where team members communicate with each other

### Creating a Team Charter

Team collaboration is also important as you write up your document

#### State your Team’s Purpose

Place your team’s purpose in the section of your team charter devoted to mission and objectives

Ask your team to brainstorm your team’s purpose and write down all of their ideas
- Then, try narrowing your team’s purpose down to one sentence

#### Outline Team Structure

In the real-world, you would have a larger team with people playing hierarchical roles:
- Manager, leader, developer, etc.

For capstone, need to be:
- Flexible
- Equitable in dividing workload
- Providing all with opportunities

Recommend sharing the administrative roles of the team:
- Rotate common paperwork weekly

At a minimum, break down your team structure and list out the responsibilities associated with each technical role:
- Consider doing a SWOT analysis to determine each person’s strengths and weaknesses regarding the project
- Assign people to technical roles accordingly

### Discussing Budge and Resource Strategies

Project budgets and resources and be difficult to secure, manage, and allocate
- In the real-world, having a section dedicated to cost management strategies can help team members during project palling and in change control situation
