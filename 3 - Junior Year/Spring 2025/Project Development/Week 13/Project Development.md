# Understanding Risk

```ad-summary
An uncertain event or conditoin, that if it occurs, has a positive or negative effect on a porject's objective.
- The effect of uncertianty, if it occurs, may be positive or negative on the objecives of th planned endeavor
- Many things are uncertian; risks are by defitnion only those uncertainties that will impact the project hsould they occur
```

## Types of Risk

![[riskanalysis2-1024x837.png]]
```ad-warning
You cannot plan for everything, as random events will happen that it cannot predict.
```

### Known Knowns

Predictable events where the system that causes them is understood. The likelihoods and impacts of these can be modelled for many sets of circumstances:
- Floods
- Budget constraints
- Regulations
- Machinery “wear and tear”

### Known Unknowns

Events that can be predicted to occur where the outcome is usually increasingly uncertain the further they are into the future
- Elections
- Component prices
- Market fluctuations
- Regulatory changes

```ad-important
*Scenarios* can be used to explore different potential outcomes
```

### Unknown Knowns

Expected events that are unpredictable in *timing* or *intensity* but can have a high impact at a specific place:
- Earthquakes
- Hurricanes
- Underutilized employee expertise

Such evens usually have **Probabilistic Forecasts**; advances in science and modelling can help to move them towards known knowns.

### Unknown Unknowns

Surprising events or outliers:
- Disruptive technologies
- Natural disasters:
	- Earthquake (Ohio)
	- Hurricane (California)
	- Meteors (anywhere)

```ad-note
In practice, only a few events are *truly* unknown unknowns
```

## Risk Management

Identifying and assessing the risks to the project and managing those risks to minimize the impact on the project.

*Prepare for the unexpected*:
- You wear your seatbelt
- You lock your doors
- You use passwords

You don’t known if any of these negative events are going to occur, but you are taking steps to manage the risks involved.

```ad-warning
Risks are always still uncertain: they have not happened yet.
```

Eventually, some of the risks that you plan for actually happen, and that’s when you have to deal with them.

### **Four Ways to Manage a Risk**:
1. Avoid
2. Mitigate
3. Transfer
4. Accept

#### Avoid

The best thing you can do with a risk is *avoid it*. If you can prevent it from happening, it will not happen.

#### Mitigate

If you cannot avoid the risk, you can mitigate it. This means taking some sort of actions that will cause it to do as little damage to your project as possible

#### Transfer

One effective way to deal with a risk is to pay someone else to accept it for you. The most common way to do this is *buy insurance*

#### Accept

When you cannot avoid, mitigate, or transfer a risk, then you *have to accept it*

Hopefully, when you accept a risk, at least you have looked at the alternatives and you known what will happen if it occurs

### Risk Mitigation Plan

Process that includes risk assessment and a mitigation strategy for those risks:
- Risk assessment includes both the identification of potential risk and the evaluation of the potential impact of the risk
- Risk mitigation is designed to eliminate or minimize the impact of the risk events- occurrences that have a negative impact on the project

## Identifying Risk

Identifying risk is both a creative and a disciplined process
- The creaative process includes brainstorming sessions where the team is asked to create a list of everything that could go wrong. All ideas are welcome at this stage witht eh evaluation of the ideas coming later.
- The disciplined process involves using checklists of potential risks and evaluating then likelihood that those events might happen on the project.

### Risk Categories

Identifying the sources of risk by category is another method:
- Technical
- Cost
- Schedule
- Client
- Contractual
- Weather
- Finanical
- Political
- Environmental
- People
