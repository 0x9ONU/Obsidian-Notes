# Risk

```ad-quote
The best-laid plans of mice and men often go awry.

- *Robert Burns*
```

No matter how well you plan, your project can always encounter unexpected problems:
- Team members get sick or quit
- Resources that you were depending on turned out to be unavailable
- An ice storm takes out the campus Internet

## Definition

Any uncertain event or condition that might affect your project
- *Not all* risks are negative
- Some events or conditions can help your project
	- Finding an easier way to do an activity
	- Experiencing lower prices for certain materials

```ad-note
Can be referred to as an opportunity, but it is technically a risk since we do not know it is going to happen.
```

```ad-warning
There are no guarantees on any project. Even the simplest activity can turn into unexpected problems
```
