```

## Kinds of Decisons

**Binary Choices**:
- Only one specific option is accepted or not

**Evaluations**:
- Statements of worth that are packed up with commitments to act
- How much are you willing to bid on a house?

**Choices**:
- Where you select a subset from larger set of alternatives
- Selecting an automobile to purchase

## Perspectives

1. *Rational*: Decisions are made to maximize utility
2. *Realistic*: Decisions are made with less practicality but more influence from personal beliefs and prior experiences

```ad-warning

```

```ad-important
