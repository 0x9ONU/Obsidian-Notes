# Mitigating Bias in Design

## Introduction: The Human Brain

The human brain is a formidable pattern matching machine.
- Much of what it does, it does outside of our awareness
- Our ‘unconscious mind' processes 200,000 times more information than our conscious frontal lobes

### Thinking, Fast and Slow

2011 publication that popularized the notion of two thinking systems in the human mind:
1. System 1 (Fast) operates automatically and quickly, with little or no effort and no sense of voluntary control
2. System 2 (Slow) allocates attention to the effortful mental activities that need it, including complex computations

#### Fast Thinking

Sifting visual, verbal, an behavioral cues, the brain helps us quickly to determine whether someone or something is friendly or hostile.

```ad-example
Dog running at you versus Tiger creeping up on you
```

Continually guides our thoughts, attitudes, and beliefs without our realization
- It helps us deal with our limited cognitive capacity
- The rapid categorization associated with it is often profoundly useful, especially at times of danger, when it can help us make life-saving decisions

```ad-warning
However, it can easily lead us astray
```
#### Slow Thinking

### Cognitive Reflection Test

Described in 2005 by Shane Frederick. Wanted to examine how people fight, or don’t fight, their intuitive thinking
- Used by behavioral financial advisors to help clients understand their decision-making process

```ad-important
While making decisions, it is important to not always go with your hunch.
1. Re-evaluate your choice
2. Even if your intuition is telling you that you made the right one
3. Reflect on it
4. Whether you are actually analyzing the problem or just looking for the easiest answer
```

## Cognitive Biases

Term introduced by Tversky and Kahneman to describe people’s systematic but flawed patterns of unconscious Reponses

*A result* of our limited cognitive capacity
- Over time, our brains associate things. 
- They form neural pathways, which become stronger every time these associations are recognized and unconsciously affirmed.

```ad-warning
EVERYONE has congitive biases
```

We are all prone to jumping to c0nclusions
- It is possible to minimize the potentially harmful effects of our cognitive biases

### Common Types

1. **Anchoring Bias** Causes us to rely too heavily on the first piece of information about a person or topic
2. **Bandwagon Effect**: The bandwagon effect is groupthink or herd mentality, where people adopt behaviors and views of a dominant group
3. **Availability Bias**: Distorts our view based on the most immediate information that readily comes to mind
4. **Confirmation Bias**: Tends to interpret new evidence to validate one’s existing beliefs
5. **Fundamental Attribution Error**: Tends to assume someone’s actions are because of their character rather than circumstances
6. **Stereotyped Bias**: Applies a widely held but fixed, oversimplified, and generalized image or idea of a particular type of person or thing.
7. **Horns and Halo Effect**: Biases perceptions of someone because of opinions of that person

### Dunning-Kruger Effect

Those with limited with limited knowledge or competence in a specific area tend to overestimate their abilities
- Those with greater expertise often underestimate their competence
- May not possess the expertise to recognize their own shortcomings, leading to inflated self-assessments.
