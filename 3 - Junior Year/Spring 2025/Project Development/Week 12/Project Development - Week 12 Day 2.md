# Mindfulness

## Introduction

### Capturing Ideas

```ad-important
Keep a notebook with you at all times
```

### Idea Incubation Period

**Subconscious Mind**
- Takes up 95-99.5% of thought
- Conorls all teh systems in the body
- Intelligent field that created the body from a single fertilized cell
- Literal and metaphoric
- Not linear (no distinction between past, present and future)
- Movie = reality = perception
- Generalized

```ad-note
The subconscious works extremely hard to solve the problems you face. When you let your mind wander, it can surface and plant those ideas inot your conscious mind.
```

### How to *Prevent* Effective Decision Making

1. **Lacking Relevant Information**: Making a decision when you donâ€™t fully understand a scenario
2. **Misidentifying the Problem**: Addressing a symptom, not the root cause.
3. **Failing to Consider Risk**: Not considering the consequences of a course of action
4. **Letting Bias Cloud your Judgment**: Not viewing your choices with objectivity

## Definition

```ad-summary
- Helps people avoid automatic reponses by learning to observe their thoughts and emotions without jduging or reacting to them.
- With mindfulness, the decision-making process becomes a thoughtful, congnitive exercise, rather than an impulsive reaction to immediate needs.
