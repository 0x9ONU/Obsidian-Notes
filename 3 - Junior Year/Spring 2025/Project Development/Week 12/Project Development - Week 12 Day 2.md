```

### Idea Incubation Period

**Subconscious Mind**
- Takes up 95-99.5% of thought
- Conorls all teh systems in the body
- Intelligent field that created the body from a single fertilized cell
- Literal and metaphoric
- Not linear (no distinction between past, present and future)
- Movie = reality = perception
- Generalized

```ad-note
The subconscious works extremely hard to solve the problems you face. When you let your mind wander, it can surface and plant those ideas inot your conscious mind.
```

### How to *Prevent* Effective Decision Making

1. **Lacking Relevant Information**: Making a decision when you don’t fully understand a scenario
2. **Misidentifying the Problem**: Addressing a symptom, not the root cause.
3. **Failing to Consider Risk**: Not considering the consequences of a course of action
4. **Letting Bias Cloud your Judgment**: Not viewing your choices with objectivity
