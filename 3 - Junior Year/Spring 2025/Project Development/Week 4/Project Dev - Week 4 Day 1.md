## How ECCS Capstone Assignments Work

### Idea Generation

Faculty work on acquiring projects from:
- Alumni
- Advisory Board
- Student-Pitched Ideas
- Faculty Ideas
- Competitions
- Etc.

Ideas are reviewed by the chair and faculty and typically grabs more ideas than necessary

### Project Selection

Students get the project pitches sent to them to choose from

Students vote for their top 3-4 choices from the proposed topics. Projects are then ranked by the faculty with the **least popular** being *cut*

### Assigning the Projects

Faculty collectively assign students to teams:
- Try to give a top choice, but it’s not guaranteed
- Ensure viability based on specified project needs
