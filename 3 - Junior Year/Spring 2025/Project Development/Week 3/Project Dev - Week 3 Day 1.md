# Abstract

TodayÂ we discussed the importance of psychological safety in team dynamics, referencing Amy Edmondson's research. I emphasized the need for team members to feel safe speaking up without fear of punishment or humiliation, and highlighted the significance of effective communication and teamwork, using medication errors in hospitals as an example. I also explained the concept of radical candor, which balances caring personally with challenging directly. Students at each table were tasked with creating Google slides demonstrating various communication scenarios, focusing on how to provide constructive feedback (I'll be exempting those who reported as ill from the group assignment.). The slides and a short video on radical candor have been uploaded to Canvas.
