# Specifications and Constraints

## Attributes

All engineering designs contain a set of **attributes** that are used to describe various parameters associated with the design
- Some are functionality while others affect its marketability

## Specifications

Quantitative, measurable criteria and standards that the product is designed to satisfy that allow designers to
- *Assess* using modleing or simulation skills
- *Measure* once prototype and production versions are built
- *Justify* design decisions to management and clients

$$\mbox{Specifications} = \mbox{metric} + \mbox{value}$$

```ad-note
Someitmes called "Evaluation Metrics"
```

### Metric - Attributes that Matter

```ad-summary
title: Definition
A system of related measures that facilitates the quantification of some particular characteristic
```

Defines the way that an engineering requirement is measured:
- Do *not* specify the implementation
- Do *not* specify how a need is met
- Do *not* specify whether a need is met
- Do allow design options to be compared

**Metric Requirements**:
1. Complete
	- All requirements should be covered
	- Each requirement should correspond to one or more metrics
2. Dependent Variables
	- Different design choices may/may not satisfy performance requirements that are measured by metrics, but the metric stays the same
3. Practical
	- Needs to be relevant to what is being designed, and measurable with the resources available

```ad-example
- Weight of robot arm
- Time for air bag deployment
- Force necessary to open door handle
- Temperature of CPU
- Beam (width) of ship
- Freuqency of use
```
