## Functions

Every element of one set should match to **only** one element of another set

```ad-info
title: Example: Is a function
collapse: open

Each value of Set 1 is set to a single element in set 2

```


## Onto Functions

When a function $f: x => y$ if every eleemtn in $y$ has a preimage in $x$

```ad-info
title: Example: One-To-One
collapse: open

Every element in set 2 has a pre-image in set 1
(One value in set 1 can pre-image set 2)

```



## One-To-One Functions

A function that never takes on the same value twice. 

Each Element of $x$ maps to a *unique* element of $y$.

$f(x_1) \ne f(x_2)$ whenever $x_1 \ne x_2$

```ad-tip
Each element of $x$ is mapped to a new elemtn each time
```
