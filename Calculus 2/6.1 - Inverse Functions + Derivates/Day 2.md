## Definition of Inverse Function

Let $f$ be a one to oen funciotn with a domain of $A$ and a range of $B$.

Its inverse function $f^-1(x)$ has a domain of $B$ and a range of $A$.

Is defined by:

$f^-1(y) = x$ ==if and only if== $f(x) = y$

```ad-info

- Domain of $f$ = Range of $f^-1$
- Range of $f$ = Domain of $f^-1$
```

- $f^-1(f(x)) = x$ for all $x âˆˆ A$
- $f(f^-1)
