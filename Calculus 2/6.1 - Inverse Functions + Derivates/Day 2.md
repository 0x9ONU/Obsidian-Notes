## Definition of Inverse Function

Let $f$ be a one to oen funciotn with a domain of $A$ and a range of $B$.

Its inverse function $f^-1(x)$ has a domain of $B$ and a range of $A$.

Is defined by:

$f^-1(y) = x$ ==if and only if== $f(x) = y$

```ad-info

- Domain of $f$ = Range of $f^-1$
- Range of $f$ = Domain of $f^-1$
```

- $f^-1(f(x)) = x$ for all $x ∈ A$
- $f(f^-1(y)) = y$ for all $y ∈ B$
```


## Find Inverse of a One-to-One Function

### Step 1

Write $y = f(x)$

### Step 2

Solve this equation for $x$ in terms of $y$

### Step 3

To express $f^-1$ as a funciton of $x$.

*Interchange* $x$ and $y$.

The resulting equation is $y = f^-1(x)$
