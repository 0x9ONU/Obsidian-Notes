## Differentiation of Inverse Functions

```ad-abstract
title: Theorem
If $f$ is one to one, continuous function defined on an interval, its inverse funtion $f^-1$ is also continuous.

color: 255, 192, 203
If $f$ is one to one, differentiabel funciton with inverse function $f^-1(x)$ and $f'(f^-1(a)) \ne 0$ then the inverse function is differentiable at $a$. $$(f^-1)'(a) = \frac{1}{f'(f^-1(a))}$$
