# Inverse of $f(x) = b^x$

Since f(x) is a 1 to 1 function it has an inverse function that goes with it.

When the function is inverted, the Domain and Range flip

$$ Domain: (-\infty, \infty) \to (0, \infty) $$
$$ Range: (0, \infty) \to (-\infty, \infty) $$

###### Inverse of $b^x$ is:
$$ f^-1(x)=\log_{b}(x)$$
