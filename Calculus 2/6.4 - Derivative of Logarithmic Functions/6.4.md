# Derivative of $ln(x)$

```ad-important
title: 
$$ \frac{d}{dx}ln(x) = \frac{1}{x}dx$$
```

```ad-warning
title:

$$ \frac{d}{dx}ln(x) = \frac{f'(x)}{f(x)}$$
```

# Examples of Logarithmic Differentiation

```ad-question
#### Find y' of $y = ln(x^2 + 3x + 5)$

```ad-check
title: Solution
- #### Let $y=ln(u)$ where $u(x) = x^2+3x+5$
	- Setup chain rule substitutions
- #### $\frac{dy}{du} = \frac{1}{u}$ and $\frac{du}{dx} = 2x + 3$
	- Find derivatives of $y$ and $u(x)$
- #### $\frac{dy}{dx} = \frac{dy}{du} * \frac{du}{dx}$
	- Basic Chain Rule Setup
- #### $y' = (\frac{1}{u})(2x+3)$
	- Replace values
- ### $\frac{2x+3}{x^2+3x+5}$
	- Put $dx$ on top and replace $u$ with $u(x) = x^2 +3x + 5$ 
```

#### Find $\frac{d}{dx}(\ln(\sin{x}))$

```ad-check
title: Solution
- #### $1/f(x) * f'(x)$
	- Prepare Differentation of $\ln$
- #### $\frac{1}{\sin{x}}(\cos{x})$
	- Differentiate
- #### $\frac{\cos{x}}{\sin{x}}$
	- Combine $dx$ and $x$
- #### $\cot{x}$

#### Differentiate $f(x) = \sqrt{1+\ln{x}}$

```ad-check
title: Solution

- #### $(1 + \ln{x})^\frac{1}{2}$
	- Replace $\sqrt{u}$ with the equivalent $u^\frac{1}{2}$ 
- #### $\frac{1}{2}(1 + \ln{x})^-\frac{1}{2} (\frac{1}{x})$
	- Differentiate
- #### $\frac{1}{2x\sqrt{1+\ln{x}}}$
	- Move negative sqrt to the bottom and put terms in best form
```

```ad-question
color: 255, 255, 0
#### Find $\frac{d}{dt}[\ln({\frac{t(t^2+1)^4}{\sqrt[3]{2t-1}}})]$
```ad-check
title: solution
- #### $\frac{d}{dt}[\ln{t(t^2+1)^4}] - \frac{d}{dt}[\ln{(2t-1)^\frac{1}{3}}]$
	- Utilize the 2nd Log Rule to split the division inside the ln to two ln that subtract each other
- #### $\frac{d}{dt}[\ln{t} + 4 \ln{(t^2+1)} -\frac{1}{3} \ln{(2t-1)}]$
	- Utilize the 1st Log Rule to Split the multiplcation insid ethe single log into two logs
	- Utilize the 3rd Log Rule to pull the exponents out as coefficients outside fo the logs
- #### $\frac{1}{t} + \frac{8t}{t^2+1} - \frac{2}{3(2t-1)}$
	- Differentiate
```


```ad-important
Whenever possible, always use **Logirithm Rules** to make a difficult problem much easier
```

## Differentiating $\ln{\lvert{x}\rvert}$

The Derivative of $\ln{\lvert{x}\rvert}$ will **Always** be $\frac{1}{x}$ for all $x$ in all real numbers as long as $x \ne 0$

# Review of Integration Power Rule

For $$\int x^n dx = \frac{x^n +1}{n+1} + C$$ Where $n \ne -1$

# Integration of Logarithms

$$ \int \frac {1}{x} dx = \ln{\lvert x\rvert} + C$$

```ad-important
The integration of natural logarithms **is** the **exception** case to the general integration power rule. Utilize this rule to solve integration cases that would not be solvable otherwise
```

# Derivative of General Logarithms

$$ \frac{d}{dx} [\log_{a}f(x)] = \frac{f'(x)}{\ln{(a)} f(x)}$$

```ad-note
Keep in mind the following trig identity: $$ \sin{2x} = 2\sin{x}\cos{x}$$
```
