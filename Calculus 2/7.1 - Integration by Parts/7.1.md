# Indefinite Integration by Parts

Use integration by parts when there are two different functions in the form $u*dv$ and $dv$ is not the derivative of *u*. 
Much like a product rule for integration, it allows two different functions to be simplified and their integral can eventually be taken.

```ad-important
### Formula for Integration by Parts: $\int udv = uv - \int vdu$
```



## Examples

```ad-example
#### Find $\int xe^xdx$

```ad-check
title: solution
- $u = x$, so $du = dx$ **AND** $dv = e^xdex$, so $v = e^x$
	- Setup the problem for integration by parts
	- We choose $x$ as our $u$ as the derivative of $x$ is just $dx$, which often is the best step for integration by parts problems
- Because $\int udv = uv - \int vdu$, then $xe^x - \int e^xdx$
	- By using the integration by parts formula, replace $u$, $v$, and $du$ with their respective values
	- From here, we are able to integrate the inner function much easier.
- $xe^x - e^x + C$
	- Since the value of $\int e^xdx$ is just $e^x$, the integral can be solved and the final answer is found
```

```ad-note
**Always** try to find a $u$ where $du$ is a less significant term. The remainding term is your $dv$.
```

### Using Integration by parts multiple times

```ad-question
### Find $\int x^2sin(x)dx$
```ad-check
title: Solution
- Let $u = x^2$ and $dv = sin(x)dx$, so $du = 2xdx$ and $v = -cosx$
	- Set $x$ to $u$ in an attempt to reduce it down to $dx$
	- Set the remainding part of the integral to $dv$ and integrate to get $v$
- Because $\int udv = uv - \int vdu$, then $-x^2cos(x) + 2\int xcos(x)dx$
	- Repalce the variables of the integration by parts formula
	- NOTE: the negative and 2 from $v$ was taken out of the integral to make the problem more simplified
- For $/int xcos(x)dx$: $u = x$ and $dv = cos(x)dx$, so $du = dx$ and $v = sin(x)dx$
	- The integral that was created by the last integration by parts cannot be solved, so we take integration by parts again to find a new value for the integral.
	- $u$ and $dv$ are utilized again, but have nothing to do with the previous integration by parts.
- Because $\int udv = uv - \int vdu$, then $-x^2cos(x) + 2[xsin(x)) - \int sin(x)dx]$
	- Plug the new integration by parts back into the integral of the old equaiton.
	- Because this new integral is able to be integrated, the new value of this integral is able to be found.
- $-x^2cos(x) + 2xsin(x) - 2\int sin(x)dx$
	- Distribute 2
- $-x^2cosx + 2xsin(x) +2cosx + C$
	- The final answer
	- The integral of $\int sin(x)dx$ is $-cos(x)+C$ and is the only integral that is taken in this equaiton.
```

### When $u$ does not simplify down to a proper $du$

```ad-important
For problems like this, utilize for when the integral created by the 2nd integration by parts becomes the same as the original integral.
```


```ad-question
#### Find \int e^xsin(x)dex
```ad-check
title: Solution
- Let $u = sin(x)$ and $dv = e^xdx$, so $du = cos(x)dx$ and $v = e^x$
	- We choose sin(x) as the derivative as we know that after taking the integral twice, sin(x) becomes -sin(x)
	- $dv$ is choosen as 
- Because $\int udv = uv - \int vdu$, then $e^xsin(x) - \int e^xcos(x)dx$
	- By using the integration by parts formula, you get the following equaiton
- Let $u = cos(x)$ and $dv = e^xdx$ 
```
