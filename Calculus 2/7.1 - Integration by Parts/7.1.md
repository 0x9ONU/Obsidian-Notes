# Indefinite Integration by Parts

Use integration by parts when there are two different functions in the form $u*dv$ and $dv$ is not the derivative of *u*. 
Much like a product rule for integration, it allows two different functions to be simplified and their integral can eventually be taken.

```ad-important
### Formula for Integration by Parts: $\int udv = uv - \int vdu$
```



## Examples

```ad-example
#### Find $\int xe^xdx$

```ad-check
title: solution
- $u = x$, so $du = dx$ **AND** $dv = e^xdex$, so $v = e^x$
	- Setup the problem for integration by parts
	- We choose $x$ as our $u$ as the derivative of $x$ is just $dx$, which often is the best step for integration by parts problems
- Because $\int udv = uv - \int vdu$, then $xe^x - \int e^xdx$
	- By using the integration by parts formula, replace $u$, $v$, and $du$ with their respective values
	- From here, we are able to integrate the inner function much easier.
- $xe^x - e^x + C$
	- Since the value of $\int e^xdx$ is just $e^x$, the integral can be solved and the final answer is found
```

```ad-note
**Always** try to find a $u$ where $du$ is a less significant term. The remainding term is your $dv$.
```

### Using Integration by parts multiple times
