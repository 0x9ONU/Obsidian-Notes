## Exponential Function

An exponential function is a function of the form $f(x) = b^x$ where $b > 0$ and $b \ne 1$

```ad-abstract
title: Theorem
If $b > 0$ and $b \ne 1$, then $f(x) = b^x$ is continuouis where the domain is a set of all real numbers and range (0, $\infty$)
```

In particular: $b^x > 0$ for all $x$
