# Graphs of Expoential Functions

## Graph of $f(x) = b^x$ Where $b > 1$

```ad-faq
title: Question
Graph $f_1(x) = 2^x$ 
```ad-check
title: Solution

```functionplot
---
title: f(x) = 2^x
xLabel: 
yLabel: 
bounds: [-4,4,0,10]
disableZoom: false
grid: true
---
f(x) = 2^x
```

```ad-note
- $x$-axis is the horizontal asymtote
- Will **ALWAYS** intersect the $y$-axis at (0, 1)
- Approaches towards $\infty$ on the right side
- Approaches towards $0$ on the left side
```

## Graph of $f(x) = b^x$ Where $0 < b < 1$

```ad-faq
title: Question
Graph $f_2(x) = (\frac{1}{2})^x$ 
```ad-check
title: Solution

```functionplot
---
title: f(x) = (1/2)^x
xLabel: 
yLabel: 
bounds: [-4,4,0,10]
disableZoom: false
grid: true
---
f(x) = (1/2)^x
```

```ad-note
- Approaches twoar
