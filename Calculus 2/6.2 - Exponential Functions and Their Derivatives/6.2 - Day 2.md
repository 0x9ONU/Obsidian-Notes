# Graphs of Expoential Functions

## Graph of $f(x) = b^x$ Where $b > 1$

```ad-faq
title: Question
color: 0, 255, 255
Graph $f_1(x) = 2^x$ 
```ad-check
title: Solution

```functionplot
---
title: f(x) = 2^x
xLabel: 
yLabel: 
bounds: [-4,4,0,10]
disableZoom: false
grid: true
---
f(x) = 2^x
```


```ad-note
- $x$-axis is the horizontal asymtote
- Will **ALWAYS** intersect the $y$-axis at (0, 1)
- Approaches towards $\infty$ on the right side
- Approaches towards $0$ on the left side
```

# Limits of Exponential Functions

```ad-summary
title: Exponentially Increasing
```

If $b\ge 1$ , then $$\lim_{x \to \infty} b^x = \infty$$ AND 
$$\lim_{x \to -\infty} b^x = 0$$


# Rules of Exponential Functions

If $a$, $b > 0$ and $x, y  \epsilon$ all real number then:

$$b^x+y = b^xb^y$$
$$b^x-y = \frac{b^x}{b^y}$$
$$(b^x)^y = b^xy$$
$$(ab)^x = a^xb^x$$
