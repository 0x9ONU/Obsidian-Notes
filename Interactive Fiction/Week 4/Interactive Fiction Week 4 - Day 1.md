# Farmlife in 1850

## Double Pen House Kentucky

The most notable feature of this single family home is an open, central hallway that separates two equal szied "pens" or rooms.

Families used one pen as living space, while the other open area - the parlor - welcomed visitng guests

The open central hallway faced the prevailing winds and served as a cool, shady setting for the family and guests


## Pioneer Farm in Iowa (Single Pen Home)

Logs homes were temporary sturcutres that provide shelter for the first few years of living in a new locaiton. For many settlers, this kind of housing was much different form waht they were accustomed to back east where milled lumber and other construciton materials were affordable and readily available. 

Started out small (16 by 18 ft.) and then would grow into more squares

```ad-note

- Puncheon flooring amde by splitting logs then hewing the flat side as smooth as possible with an adze or a broad axe. The rounded sides were placed downward.
- Glass windows allowed more light into the cabin, but the panes would need to be purchased, each individually and then fitted into a window frame.

## Farm Animals

### Oxen (working bovines)

Oxen are cattle that have been trained to do work such as pulling plows or carts, by using a yoke. 

In 1850, farmers needed a milk producing cow that could work in rough, stony pastures and survive in harsh winters. The oxen are very storng and have a slow steady pace that also makes them well-suited for hauling logs and firewood.
