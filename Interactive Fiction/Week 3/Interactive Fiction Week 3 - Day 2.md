- Story Design for IF

```

## Conventional Plot Design: Freytag's Pyramid

- Exposition -
- Inciting Incident --
- Rising Action ---------------
- Climax -----------------------------
- Falling Action -----------------
- Resolution ----------

```ad-warning
### Problem with this design

Based on Aristotle, who wrote in Classical Greece where plays and sources of fiction will last 2-3 hours. It does not translate well into more modern fiction and IF
```

# IF Story Design: Room by Room

**"Flash FIction"** model (6 words - 280 characters)

Stories should have
- Setting
- Problem/conflict
- At least one character
- A change

#### How would this work for your story?

- Front yard (N)
- Front Hallway
- Kitchen (NW)
- Bedroom (NE)
- Back Hallway
- Common Room (SW
- Parlor (SE)
- Backyard (S)

```ad-note
Every Room should have something to do, so your game does not become flat
```


# E.M. Forseter: Story v. Plot

**Story**: Events of a story in chronological order

**Plot:** Events as the reader "sees" them

```ad-example
Finding a diary; learning something from a character
```

```ad-important
In IF, you utilize objects in the environment to add to the plots like:
- Diaries
- Paper Scraps
```

### Devices to Reveal Avatar's feelings/memories

- Reaction to a Character
- Reaction to something in the environment
