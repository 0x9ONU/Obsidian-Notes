# Misogyny in the Automobile Business

Women are 73% more likely to be injured n a crash when compared to males, while they only make up for under half the automobiel crashes among US drivers

This puts women at a higher risk then males when they get into an accident

This is due to only male test dummies being used to test the safety of cars since the 1970s

# Representation

The extent to which members of a particular demographic are present in an environment

```ad-example
##### Demographics affected by Representation include:
- Gender
- Race
- Age
- Religion
- Sexual Orientation
```

# Gender in Video Games

Even though women make up about half of vide games players:

- They are significantly underrepresented as cahracters.
- They are protrayed to reflect traditional gender roels, sexual objectification, or stereotypes!
