# People - A Security Problem

The operational model of computer security understands that preventative technologies are not perfect. 

Humans are one of the biggest reasons why preventative technologies are not sufficient:
- Causes errors
- Make mistakes
- Are easily misled or fooled.

## Social Engineering

The process of an unauthorized individual convincing an authorized individual to provide them with a confidential information or access to something that they should not have.
- Utilizes various deceptive practices

It is very successful due to:
- The basic desire of most people to be helpful
	- We will answer a question they have rather than try to be suspicious 
	- This information that they will ask could be enough to help the attacker out

```ad-example
An attacker who is attempting to exploit the natural tendency of people to be helpful may take one of several approaches:
- Ask a qustion, hoping to immediately obtain the desired information. 
	- Works for basic information
- Attempt to engage the target in conversation to envoke sympathy to give up more sensitive information
- Appeal to the individual's ego
	- Talk them up saying how well they did to solve a non-existant problem
	- Proceed to ask them for information
```

- Individuals normally seek to avoid confrontation and trouble
	- The attacker may intimidate and threaten to tell someone higher than them that they provided a bad service
	- Really strong in companies that have a *strict hierarchical structure* like the military

```ad-note
Can also be done thourgh non-direct means such as fake e-mails, fake paperwork, and more
```

# Tools

Social Engineering tools rely on psychology rather than knowledge on software and hardware of a computer.
- Used to exploit people's own biases and beliefs to prevent them from using standard procedures or good judgement
- Social engineers switch these tools in and out when necessary

## Principles (Reasons for Effectiveness)

```ad-note
title: First Reason Snowballing
The more infomration an individual has about an organization, the easier it is to confince others that they are part of the organization as well
```

### Authority

Leads to an environment where one party feels at risk in challenging another over an issue.
- Can be used to entice the target to act in a particular manner or get punished

```ad-important
The best defense to this is to have a strong set of policies that has no exceptions. 
```

### Intimidation

Can either be subtle, through perceived power, or more direct, through the use of communications that build an expectation of superiority

### Consensus

A group-wide decision done through rounds of group negotiations.
- Can be manipulated by the attacker to get the desired outcome

### Scarcity

Implied scarcity can create a perception of scarcity, and the attacker can use this motivation to help the target make a decision quickly without deliberation

### Familiarity

Based around the fact that people do things for others they feel connected to. Social engineers exploit this by making misplaced trust.
- Focuses the conversation on familiar items rather than differences

### Trust

Having an understanding of how something will act under specific conditions
- An attacker can shape the perceptions of a target so that they will apply judgements and come to the false conclusion that they can be trusted

### Urgency

When time is manipulated to prompt shortcuts that can lead to opportunities for interjections in the process.
- Limited time offers or sudden opportunities

```ad-important
Perception is key
- CGiving a target a reasont o believe that they can take advantage of this time-based opportunity can cause them to act in a certain manner
```

## Defenses

For impersonation, **always** make employees to ask to see a person's ID before engaging with them.
- Also challenge people such as delivery drives and contract workers

```ad-note
If this becomes standard process, no one becomes offended AND if they do, they come off suspicous
```

**Create periodic training periods that are tailored to what is currently being expected** 

# Attacks

Social Engineers use many different psychological and technical means to get a user to perform actions on a machine that they would normally not do such as:
- Clicking a link to a web page
- Running a program
- Saving information
- Opening a file

## Impersonation

The attacker assumes a role that is recognized by the person being attacked, and in assuming that role, uses the victim's own biases against their better judgment to follow procedures

Can occur in many different ways in many different places
- in person
- over a phone
- online

### Third-Party Authorization

Uses previously obtained information about a project, deadline, or boss to:
1. Arrive with something the victim is expecting or would seem normal
2. Uses the guise of a project in trouble or some other situation where the attacker will be viewed as helpful or not upset
3. Name drops "Mr. Big" who is unreachable at that moment to avoid a reference check

```ad-note
The attacker seldom asks for anything that would be unreasonable or unlikelyt o be shared based on the circumstances
```

### Contractors/Outside Parties

Attackers take advantage of the fact that organizations hire outside workers to do various tasks around it. 
- Could dress up in a uniform that matches the contractor
- If challenged, they can use the sympathy card saying they are filing in for another person

They are able to roam the halls unnoticed without suspicion and take as much information as they can

### Help Desk/Tech Support

A social engineer can pose as an employee and get:
- a password reset
- Details about some system

Can also pose *as* the help desk employee to get:
- System status

### Online Attacks

Technology plays an intermediary role in communication chains

```ad-note
Some older forms of online attacks have become less effective today because people have become wary of them

Phishing attempts via e-mail and social media, however, are still very prevalent today.
