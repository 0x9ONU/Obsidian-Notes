# People - A Security Problem

The operational model of computer security understands that preventative technologies are not perfect. 

Humans are one of the biggest reasons why preventative technologies are not sufficient:
- Causes errors
- Make mistakes
- Are easily misled or fooled.

## Social Engineering

The process of an unauthorized individual convincing an authorized individual to provide them with a confidential information or access to something that they should not have.
- Utilizes various deceptive practices

It is very successful due to:
- The basic desire of most people to be helpful
	- We will answer a question they have rather than try to be suspicious 
	- This information that they will ask could be enough to help the attacker out

```ad-example
An attacker who is attempting to exploit the natural tendency of people to be helpful may take one of several approaches:
- Ask a qustion, hoping to immediately obtain the desired information. 
	- Works for basic information
- Attempt to engage the target in conversation to envoke sympathy to give up more sensitive information
- Appeal to the individual's ego
	- Talk them up saying how well they did to solve a non-existant problem
	- Proceed to ask them for information
```

- Individuals normally seek to avoid confrontation and trouble
	- The attacker may intimidate and threaten to tell someone higher than them that they provided a bad service
	- Really strong in companies that have a *strict hierarchical structure* like the military

```ad-note
Can also be done thourgh non-direct means such as fake e-mails, fake paperwork, and more
```

# Tools

Social Engineering tools rely on psychology rather than knowledge on software and hardware of a computer.
- Used to exploit people's own biases and beliefs to prevent them from using standard procedures or good judgement
- Social engineers switch these tools in and out when necessary

## Principles (Reasons for Effectiveness)

```ad-note
title: First Reason Snowballing
The more infomration an individual has about an organization, the easier it is to confince others that they are part of the organization as well
```

### Authority

Leads to an environment where one party feels at risk in challenging another over an issue.
- Can be used to entice the target to act in a particular manner or get punished

```ad-important
The best defense to this is to have a strong set of policies that has no exceptions. 
```

### Intimidation

Can either be subtle, through perceived power, or more direct, through the use of communications that build an expectation of superiority

### Consensus

A group-wide decision done through rounds of group negotiations.
- Can be manipulated by the attacker to get the desired outcome

### Scarcity

Implied scarcity can create a perception of scarcity, and the attacker can use this motivation to help the target make a decision quickly without deliberation

### Familiarity

Based around the fact that people do things for others they feel connected to. Social engineers exploit this by making misplaced trust.
- Focuses the conversation on familiar items rather than differences

### Trust

Having an understanding of how something will act under specific conditions
- An attacker can shape the perceptions of a target so that they will apply judgements and come to the false conclusion that they can be trusted

### Urgency

When time is manipulated to prompt shortcuts that can lead to opportunities for interjections in the process.
- Limited time offers or sudden opportunities

```ad-important
Perception is key
- CGiving a target a reasont o believe that they can take advantage of this time-based opportunity can cause them to act in a certain manner
```

## Defenses

For impersonation, **always** make employees to ask to see a person's ID before engaging with them.
- Also challenge people such as delivery drives and contract workers

```ad-note
If this becomes standard process, no one becomes offended AND if they do, they come off suspicous
```
