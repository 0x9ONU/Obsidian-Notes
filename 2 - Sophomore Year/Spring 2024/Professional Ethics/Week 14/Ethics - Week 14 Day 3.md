# Whistleblowing

## Bok

**Features**
1. Dissent: Shedding public light on a private negligence/abuse that may cause imminent/specific threat that could cause public danger
2. Breach of loyalty with organization by speaking outside organization, which reveals entrusted information without authorization
3. Accusation: Assign responsibility to specific persons

**Ethics of Whistleblowing**
1. Weigh potential harms of speaking out versus potential harms of not speaking out. Speaking out justified only if the harm of not speaking is greater than the the harm of speaking.
2. Speaking out is a last resort. They must exhaust all available internal avenues first to preserve loyalty if possible.
3. Make accusation openly and accept responsibility. Anonymous discourse may happen only if there is reasonable fear of retaliation.
4. Act to minimize bias and avoid error. Check facts and scrutinize motives.
```ad-important
Whistleblowing is morally *permissible* if 1-4 are **ALL** met.
```

## Davis

**Paradoxes**
- Paradox of Burden: Whistleblowers usually act at significant risk to themselves. (Career, finances, relationships). Duty of Beneficence does not required such risk-taking.
- Paradox of missing harm:  Many cases of whistleblowing are *not* about preventing serious harm.
- Paradox of failure: Generally, acts of whistleblowing do not prevent much harm

**Ethics of Whistleblowing**:

```ad-important
Whistleblowing is moraly **required** if it meets the five requirements:
```

1. What you reveal derives from *your* work for an organization
2. You are voluntary member of your organization 
3. You believe your organization, though legitimate, is engaged in serious *wrongdoing*
4. You believe *your* work for the organization will contribute (more or less directly) to the wrongdoing if (but *not* only if) you don't publicly reveal.
5. You are epistemically justified in your beliefs (evidence to convince others)
