# Kantian Ethics

```ad-example
When someone does not choose to pay their taxes, they may argue that it can bring them more happiness to them and their family than the government and could never get caught.
```

However, despite the outcome, an action can still be wrong as:
- They have simple immorality
- What they did was unfair
- They took advantage of the  system
- They broke the rule that work to everyone's benefit
- They violated the rights of others

**Immanuel Kant** (1724-1804)
- Believed that actions can be morally wrong regardless of their outcome
- Became one of the most important voice of opposition to utilitarianism
- Claims that the ultimate point of morality is to **improve well-being** rather than *justice*

## Consistency and Fairness

People can be inconsistent to how they either follow or break the rules.
- Similar cases of morality checks can be treated differently based on what situation they are put in

In order to attach consistence, two tests of morality are used:
1. What if everyone did that? *If disastrous results would occur if everyone did X, then X is immoral*.
2. How would you like it if I did that to you?

```ad-important
These questions are able to help point out the inconsistency that someone who is acting immoral gives to himself.
```

```ad-example
- If everyone cheated on their taxes, society would crumble.
- If everyone used the emergency lanes in traffic jams, then ambulances and fire trucks would often fail to provide neede dhelp, leaving many to die.
- If every candidate resorted to dirty tricks, then the entire poltiical system would become corrupted.
```

```ad-warning
It could lead to untrue cases; however. Be careful how you use it and avoid using it *against* a non-morally wrong group of people.
- Homosexuals will not lead to disaster... maybe >:]
```

**Golden Rule**
- Treat others as you would like to be treated.
- Classis test of morality
- Tests consistency
- **NOT** the ultimate test to morality

```ad-example
If you do not want to be slandered or exploited, then do not do such things to others
```

## The Principle of Universability

```ad-note
Kant aimed to fix the two basic tests of inconsistency by making a single principle that captures both questions while fixing their errors
```

**Principle of Universalizability*
- An act is morally acceptable if, and only if, its **maxim** is **universalizable**.
- **Maxim** - A principle or action you give yourself when you are about to do something.
	- States what you are about to do, and why you are about to do it.
	- Kant believes that every action we take could have a maxim
	- If we don't have a maxim, we are not acting
	- Two people doing the same thing might have their own maxim
- Has everything to do with the intension of the action rather than the consequence of that action.
	- If someone is evil and does an negative action that ends up being a net positive, it should not be excusable regardless.

```ad-note
For Kant, the mroality of our actions has nothing to do with results, and EVERYTHING to do with our intentions and reasons for action.
```


**Testing for Universalizability**
1. Formulate your maxim clearly - state what you intend to do and why you intend to do it.
2. Imagine a world in which **everyone** supports and acts on your maxim.
3. Then ask: Can the goal of my action be achieved in such a world?

## Hypothetical and Categorical Imperatives

When we act on a maxim that is not universalized, then we are contradicting ourselves.
- When someone acts on assumptions and bad reason, they are acting irrationally.

**Hypothetical Imperatives**
- Imperatives/commands of reason.
- Command us to do whatever is needed in order to get what we care about.
- Tell us how to achieve our goals.

```ad-example
If my goal is to lose twenty pounds, then reason requires me to forgo a pint of ice cream.
```

**Categorical Imperatives**
- Commands of reason that are rational requirements that apply to a person regardless of what he or she cares about.
- Applies to everyone who possesses reason.

```ad-note
Kant believed that *all moral duties* are contegorical imperatives.
```

### Argument for the Irrationality of Immorality

If all moral duties are categorical imperatives, then we act rationally when we act immorally and vice-versa.

**Kant's Argument**:
1. If you are rational, then you are consistent.
2. If you are consistent, then you obey the principle of universalizability.
3. If you obey the principle of universalizability, then you act morally.
4. Therefore, if you are rational, then you act morally.
5. Therefore, if you act immorally, then you are irrational.

## Assessing the Principle of Universalizability

```ad-warning
Fails as a general test for the morality of our actions.
- A maxim's universalizability is **NOT** a guarantee of an action's rightness.
```

```ad-example
If a robber chose to rob a bank in order to put a bank out of business, it would still pass the principle of universalizabililty.
- If everyone acted that way, the goal *could* be achieved.
```

## Kant on Absolute Moral Duties

```ad-note
Kant **never** gave an arguemnt for the claim that moral rules prohibit things such as lying and killing are **absolute**
```

In a conflict between moral duty and other demands, such as law, self-interest, or tradition, morality wins.

Kant failed to realize that his philosophy can justify lying to an inquiring murderer.

```ad-important
An action cannot be determiend to be right or wrong *until* we know its maxim.
- This makes it very difficult to make an aciton universalizable.
- It makes it much harder than Kant thought to defend the existence of absolute moral duties
```

## The Principle of Humanity

```ad-summary
title: Definition
Always treat a human being (yourself included) as an end, and *never* as a mere means.
```

**Humanity** - All rational and autonomous beings regardless of species.

**Treating someone as an end** - With the respect they deserve

**Treating someone as a means** - Dealing with them so that they help you achieve one of your goals.
