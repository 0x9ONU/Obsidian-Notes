# Nature of consequentialism
- Consequentialism says an action is morally required because it produces the best results
	- producing the best results is referred to as optimific
- There are five steps to this process
	- Identify what is intrinsically good
	- Happiness, autonomy, knowledge, virtue
	- Identify what is intrinsically bad
	- pain, betrayal of innocents, sadism, anguish
	- Determine all options
	- For each option determine the results
	- Pick which options yield the best results
# Act utilitarianism
Act utilitarianism is a part of consequentialist theory
Act utilitarianism says well being is the only thing that is intrinsically valuable
it also says that an action is morally required if and only if it does more to improve overall wellbeing than any other action
Benefits of utilitarianism
It is impartial
Everyone's wellbeing counts
It justifies many of our basic moral beliefs
Provides advice on how to resolve moral conflicts 
utilitarianism has only one rule, maximize well being
Provides great moral flexibility
Only one rule to a utilitarian is absolute
Utilitarianism insists that everyone is apart of the moral community
Some difficulties of utilitarianism
Utilitarianism is always asking us to be for the good of the whole, not ourselves
Utilitarians distinguish between a decision procedure and a standard of rightness
utilitarianism is in itself a standard of rightness
A decision procedure is a method to reliably guide our decisions
A standard of rightness tells us conditions that are necessary/sufficient for an action to be morally right
Most consequentialists think that a standard of rightness fails as a decision procedure
Utilitarianism is constantly self sacrificing

Utilitarianism leaves no room for supererogation or actions that are beyond the call of duty
no action can be outstandingly good as it is the action you should have taken anyways
Utilitarianisms impartiality is a double edged sword as no ones happiness is above any one else's
utilitarianism often leads to committing injustices
