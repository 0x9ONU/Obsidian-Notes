# Kantian Ethics

```ad-example
When someone does not choose to pay their taxes, they may argue that it can bring them more happiness to them and their family than the government and could never get caught.
```

However, despite the outcome, an action can still be wrong as:
- They have simple immorality
- What they did was unfair
- They took advantage of teh system
- They broke the rule that work to everyone's benefit
- They violated the rights of others

**Immanuel Kant** (1724-1804)
- Believed that actions can be morally wrong regardless of their outcome
- Became one of the most important voice of opposition to utilitarianism
- Claims that the ultimate point of morality is to **improve well-being** rather than *justice*

## Consistency and Fairness

People can be inconsistent to how they either follow or break the rules.
- Similar cases of morality checks can be treated differently based on what situation they are put in

In order to attach consistence, two tests of morality are used:
1. What if everyone did that? *If disastrous results would occur if everyone did X, then X is immoral*.
2. How would you like it if I did that to you?

```ad-important
These questions are able to help point out the inconsistency that someone who is acting immoral gives to himself.
```

```ad-example
- If everyone cheated on their taxes, society would crumble.
- If everyone used the emergency lanes in traffic jams, then ambulances and fire trucks would often fail to provide neede dhelp, leaving many to die.
- If every candidate resorted to dirty tricks, then the entire poltiical system would become corrupted.
```

```ad-warning
It could lead to untrue cases; however. Be careful how you use it and avoid using it *against* a non-morally wrong group of people.
- Homosexuals will not lead to disaster... maybe >:]
```

**Golden Rule**
- Treat others as you would like to be treated.
- Classis test of morality
- Tests consistency
- **NOT** the ultimate test to morality

```ad-example
If you do not want to be slandered or exploited, then do not do such things to others
```

## The Principle of Univerzability

```ad-note
Kant aimed to fix the two basic tests of inconsistency by making a single principle that captures both questions while fixing their errors
```

**Principle of Universalizability*
- An act is morally acceptable if, and only if, its **maxim** is **universalizable**.
- **Maxim** - A principle or action you give yourself when you are about to do something.
	- States what you are about to do, and why you are about to do it.
	- Kant believes that every action we take could have a maxim
	- If we don't have a maxim, we are not acting
	- Two people doing the same thing might have their own maxim
- Has everything to do with the intension of the action rather than the consequence of that action.
