# The Ethics of Prima Facie Duties

```ad-summary
Most moral theories fall under **ethical absolutism** and **ethical monism**
```

### Absolutism

Moral rules are absolute and may never be broken.
- This is not matter how much good is achieved or how much harm is prevented from doing so

### Monism

Based around a **fundamental** moral role, a moral rule where the justification for existence does not depend on any more general or more basic moral rule.

### Pluralism

There is more than just one ultimate, fundamental moral principle that dictates the right from wrong.


## Ethical Pluralism and Prima Facie Duties

```ad-summary
title: Absolute Pluralism
Regards all of its fundamental moral rules as absolute.
```ad-warning
However, looking at thsi rule may lead to contradicitons between rules
- What if two rules say an action is morally correct, while another say its immoral?
- In the case of conflict, one rule has to be chosen over the other and they both cannot be obeyed.
```

```ad-important
To be ethical pluralist, both monism and aboslutism should be forgotten.
- Each of these rules is nonabsolute, and in some cases, it is morally acceptable to break them.
```

**Prima Facie Duty** - When there is moral pluralism, a duty may sometimes be overridden by another fundamental duty. 
- Create by Dr. W.D Ross
- Even though it is always good to keep a promise, the promise might be broken for the greater good if a different duty is met.
- Warns that absolutism in all forms is impossible.

```ad-example
title: The **seven** prima facie duties:
1. *Fidelity*: Keeping our promises, being faithful to our word.
2. *Reparations*: Reparing harm that we have done.
3. *Gratitude*: Appropriately acknowledging benefits that others have given us.
4. *Justice*: Ensuring that virtue is rewarded and vice punished.
5. *Beneficence*: Enhancing the intelligence, virtue, or pleasure of others.
6. *Self-improvement*: Making onself more intelligent or virtuous.
7. *Non-maleficence*: Preventing harm to others

```ad-note
Ross says that this list is incomplete, but these should **ALWAYS** be included
```

```ad-warning
These are not really duties, but rather permanent moral reasons that partly dtermine whether an action is truly morally required.
```

## The Advantages of Ross's View

```ad-important
The greatest strength of the theory is that it is able to accommodate our sense that there is more than just a single fundamental moral consideration.
```

- Explains the widespread belief that the moral rules may sometimes acceptably be broken.
	- There are circumstances in which it is morally acceptable to break a promise, allow harm on others, pass up a chance for self-improvement, etc.
- Easily avoids contradiction
- The heart of prima facie duties are always morally *important*, but not always morally *decisive*.\
- Moral regret allows for a lesser value that has been sacrificed to still have weight in a circumstance.

```ad-important
**Simple reasoning test**: "there is a prime facie duty to act in a certain way *if and only if* it would always be appropriate to regret our failure to act that way."
```

## A Problem for Ross's View

```ad-warning
Ross failes to create a strict rule of when or when not to deny a rule over another.
- There is no set list that makes one duty take precidence over another.
- No clear way to decide a course of action in a conflict of duties.
```

## Prima Facie Duties and the Testing of Moral Theories

```ad-important
Ross sets his duties such that they run parallel with common sense, which makes his thoery stronger.
```

Ross rejects consequentialism by using this part of his theory
- Said that it is fatally flawed because it failed to appreciate the variety of fundamental moral concerns.
- We must resist the charm of a single unifying principle

Ross also says that we reject basic beliefs when we can show that they can't all be true.
- Says that consequentialism and Kantianism are both too morally narrow by having a single fundamental moral rule.

```ad-note
For Ross's opponents who did not agree with the base seven principles, he would ask them to think more carefully about its importance and that what he brought up is not based on error. If this does not work, he believes the person is mistaken. There is nothing that anyone could convince him if he was wrong.
```

## Knowing the Right Thing to Do

When faced with a moral conflict between two duties, Ross says that we can never be certain that the balance we strike is the correct one.
- There is no definite method of choosing which way to go.
- You are on your own after deciding what is morally important in that moment.
- Based on your experience and insight rather than a specific procedure.

However, it is all not bad:
1. The idea of a comprehensive moral decision procedure may not be plausible. A concrete set of guidelines may not be entirely necessary in moral decisions
2. The absence of a decision procedure for arriving at conclusions is actually the default situation across all areas of thinking. 

```ad-note
All theories fall on a specturm of virtues that ultimately determines who and how it is used in a certain situation.
```

```ad-important
When it comes to morallity, there are a lot of difficult cases that require judgement by juggling the respect given to each prima facie duty. This choice can never be known to be the have the best outcome in a difficult scenario.

## Question

In a 1946 essay, the French existentialist philosopher Jean-Paul Sartre describe a dilemma faced by one of his students. The young man's oldest brother had been killed in the German offensive of 1940, and the young man felt compelled to avenge him. Meanwhile, he lived alone with his mother, who was frail and still deeply affected by the death of her oldest son. The young man was her only consolation. According to Sartre's retelling, he realized that his disappearance or death in war would plunge his mother into despair. The young man found himself torn between his personal devotion to his mother and the noble cause of fighting with the anti-Nazi resistance. Sartre suggested that the dilemma could not be answered by an ethical theory, writing, "nothing remains but to trust our instincts."

Sartre thought that the young man's dilemma couldn't be resolved by any ethical theory and that the young man would have to decide based on instinct. Are there some moral dilemmas without an answer? In such cases, should we simply trust our instincts?
