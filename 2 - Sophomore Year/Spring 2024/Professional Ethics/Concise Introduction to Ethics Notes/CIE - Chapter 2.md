# Moral Reasoning

Has two things:
- A set of reasons
- A conclusion that the reasons support

**Argument**: A chains of thought in which reasons (**Premises**) are offered in support a conclusion
- Uses words like *therefore, hence, thus,* or *so*

```ad-warning
An argument may fail by either:
- Coming to the wrong conclusion
- Using bad reasoning
```

```ad-important
Two tests for good moral reasoning:
1. We must avoid false beliefs
2. The logic of our moral thinking must be rigorous and error-free
```

Even though it is difficult to find if a belief is true or false, it can be supported by evidence.

A failure in logic can also lead to a failure of an argument.

## Validity and Soundness

```ad-example
A ***bad*** moral argument example:
$$\space$$
$$\space$$
Since (a) heroin is a drug, and (b) selling heroin is illegal, heroin use is immoral.
```

In this case, even though both premises are true, they do not support the conclusion.
- It fails to use proper logical structure

**Three-Part Test for Logically Perfect Form**:
1. Identify all of the argument's premises
2. Imagine that all of them are true (even if you know that some are false).
3. Then ask yourself this question: supposing that all of the premises were true, could the conclusion be false? *If yes*, the argument is invalid. The premises do not guarantee the conclusion. *If no,* the argument is valid

**Validity**:
- Matter of how well and argument's premises support the conclusion
- Nothing to do with the *actual* truth or falsity of an argument's premises or conclusions.

```ad-note
Valid arguments may contain *false* premises and *false* conclusions
```

```ad-example
A shaky argument to convince that John QUincy Adams was the ninth president of the United States:
1. John Quincy Adams was eitehr the eight or the ninth US president
2. John Quincy Adams was not the eight US president.
Therefore,
3. John Qunicy Adams was the ninth US president.
```

Even though the premises are false,  the reasoning and logic is perfect, which makes it a **valid argument**.

```ad-important
title: **Sound** Arguments
A good argument needs both **truth** and **logic**
```

Because of this, arguments are **NOT** true or false, they can be:
- Valid or invalid
- Sound or unsound
