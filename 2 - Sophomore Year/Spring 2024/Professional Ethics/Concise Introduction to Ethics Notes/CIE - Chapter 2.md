# Moral Reasoning

Has two things:
- A set of reasons
- A conclusion that the reasons support

**Argument**: A chains of thought in which reasons (**Premises**) are offered in support a conclusion
- Uses words like *therefore, hence, thus,* or *so*

```ad-warning
An argument may fail by either:
- Coming to the wrong conclusion
- Using bad reasoning
```

```ad-important
Two tests for good moral reasoning:
1. We must avoid false beliefs
2. The logic of our moral thinking must be rigorous and error-free
```

Even though it is difficult to find if a belief is true or false, it can be supported by evidence.

A failure in logic can also lead to a failure of an argument.

## Validity and Soundness

```ad-example
A ***bad*** moral argument example:
$$\space$$
$$\space$$
Since (a) heroin is a drug, and (b) selling heroin is illegal, heroin use is immoral.
```

In this case, even though both premises are true, they do not support the conclusion.
- It fails to use proper logical structure

**Three-Part Test for Logically Perfect Form**:
1. Identify all of the argument's premises
2. Imagine that all of them are true (even if you know that some are false).
3. Then ask yourself this question: supposing that all of the premises were true, could the conclusion be false? *If yes*, the argument is invalid. The premises do not guarantee the conclusion. *If no,* the argument is valid

**Validity**:
- Matter of how well and argument's premises support the conclusion
- Nothing to do with the *actual* truth or falsity of an argument's premises or conclusions.

```ad-note
Valid arguments may contain *false* premises and *false* conclusions
```

```ad-example
A shaky argument to convince that John QUincy Adams was the ninth president of the United States:
1. John Quincy Adams was eitehr the eight or the ninth US president
2. John Quincy Adams was not the eight US president.
Therefore,
3. John Qunicy Adams was the ninth US president.
```

Even though the premises are false,  the reasoning and logic is perfect, which makes it a **valid argument**.

```ad-important
title: **Sound** Arguments
A good argument needs both **truth** and **logic**
```

Because of this, arguments are **NOT** true or false, they can be:
- Valid or invalid
- Sound or unsound

## Necessary and Sufficient Conditions

There are a few necessary ideas that are needed to construct a valid argument with good logical structure.

### Sufficient Condition

A guarantee if one statement is true, then another one is true.
- If X is a sufficient condition of Y, then X guarantees Y.
- When X is true, THEN Y is true.

```ad-example
- Being human is a sufficient condition of being a mammal
- Having a child is a sufficient conditon of being a parent.
```

### Necessary Condition

A requirement that ***for*** one statement to be true, the other **MUST** be true.
- If X is a necessary condition of Y, then X is needed for Y; X is required for Y.
- Y can be true ONLY IF X is true.

```ad-example
- Having some money is a necessary condition of being a millionaire
- Having a brain is necessary condition of being a philosopher
```

```ad-warning
Do not speak in sufficient or necessary conditions
```

### Biconditional

When a claim supplies both necessary and sufficient conditions
- "If and only if"

```ad-example
- An unmarried male is boht sufficient and necessary for being a bachelor.
- If someone is an unmarried male, then he's a bachelor, and he's a bachelor only if he's an unmarried male.
```

### Valid Argument Forms

```ad-note
This part of the chapter uses variables as placeholds for sentences.
```

#### Modus Ponens

The most basic form of an argument.
- Every way the argument can be made is **logically valid**

```ad-important
1. If P, then Q.
2. P
$$\space$$ Therefore,
3. Q
```

```ad-example
**Example 1:**
1. If humans have rights, then you have rights.
2. Humans have rights.
Therefore,
3. You have rights.

$$\space$$
**Example 2:**
1. If you have rights, then pencils have rights.
2. You have rights.
Therefore,
3. Pencils have rights.
```

In the first argument, the argument is both valid and sound as its logic is good and it comes o a true conclusion with true premises.

The second argument has perfect logic, but the first premise is false, which makes the conclusion false as well.

This style of argument works as:
- It relies on a **conditional** aka an "if-then" sentence.
- If = **antecedent**
- Then = **consequent**

Steps:
1. The modus ponens argument makes sure that its antecedent is a sufficient condition of its consequent.
2. If the conditional is true, then it guarantees the consequent is true.

#### Modus Tollens

```ad-important
1. P only if Q
2. Q is false
$$\space$$ Therefore,
3. P is false.
```

If P is true only when Q is true, and Q is false, then it concludes that P must be false.

#### Hypothetical Syllogism

```ad-important
1. If P, then Q
2. If Q, then R.
$$\space$$ Therefore,
3. If P, then R
```

Can have **three or more** as long as each additional one is a condition that takes the consequent of the previous conditional and makes it the antecedent of the next.

### Fallacies

- A mistake in reasoning
- Formal when a kind of argument all of whose instances are logically invalid.
	- NEVER logically valid.
- Informal when there are any other kinds of mistaken pattern in reasoning.

#### Fallacy of Denying the Antecedent

```ad-warning
Avoid the following:
1. If P, then Q
2. P is flase.
$$\space$$ Therefore,
3. Q is false
```

```ad-example
1. If you buy this item now, then you will get the item 50% off
2. You don't buy the item now
$$\space$$ Therefore,
3. You will not get the item for 50% off
$$\space$$
1. If I'm a millionaire, then I have at least ten dollars.
2. I'm not a millionaire.
$$\space$$ Therefore,
3. I don't have ten dollars (FALSE)
```

By denying the antecedent of a conditional, you do not give any basis for denying the consequent. There may be many antecedents that can be used to prove the consequent.

#### Fallacy of Affirming the Consequent

```ad-warning
Avoid the following:
1. If P, then Q
2. Q is true
$$\space$$ Therefore,
3. P is true
```

```ad-example
1. If life is meaningful, then God exists
2. God *does* exist
$$\space$$ Therefore,
3. Life is meaningful
```
