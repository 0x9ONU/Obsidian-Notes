# Social Contract Theory/Contractarianism

It tells us that laws are just if, and only if, they reflect the terms of a social contract.

```ad-summary
Actions are morally right just bvecause they are permitted by rules that free, equal, and rational people would gree to live by, on the condition that others obey these rules as well.
```

## The Background of the Social Contract Theory

Goes back to ancient Greece in the *Republic* era when Plato's brothers asked Socrates about the social contract view.
- Argued that to fight against the need for having the most power over everyone, that it is important to conditionally curb self-interest and cooperate with each other when necessary.
- Social contract theory tells us that we each do best for ourselves by agreeing to limit the direct pursuit of self-interest and accept a bargain that gets us a pretty decent life.
- Keeps us from both an absolute glamorous life and one that is terrible.

## The Prisoner's Dilemma

```ad-note
We each want as much of the scarce resources in life. We try get as much as rationally reasonable in order to prevent it in other people's lives.
```

**Prisoner's Dilemmas:** Situations where everyone in it would be better off by scaling back their pursuit of self-interest
- Named after the first scenario of its kind:
	- Two thieves are caught and sent to separate detention cells. 
	- Both thieves decide to stay quiet.
	- However, the guards tell them that they know that they made a deal beforehand.
	- If one snitches to the other, the one who snitched gets out scot-free and the other gets 6 years.
	- If neither snitches, they get two years
	- If both snitch, they get four years.
- If they remain silent, they take the cooperative strategy, which honors the deal.
- If they both confess, they betray each other, breaking each other's promise and their partnership.
- Both of them are going to betray each other because they know that they are self-interested and rational.
- "no matter what his accomplice does, each criminal will be better off by confessing"
- **Warns that the rational pursuit of self-interest will lead people to refuse to cooperate with one another regardless of a worse outcome**

| ---       | Silent | Confesses |
| --------- | ------ | --------- |
| **Silent**    | 2, 2   | 6, 0          |
| **Confesses** | 0, 6       | 4, 4          |
## Cooperation and the State of Nature

```ad-important
Competitors do not cooperate because it is seen as being too risky.
- Join in the competition or be crushed
```

**Thomas Hobbes' State of Nature** - A situation where there was no government, no central authority, no group with the exclusive power to enforce the will on others. 
- The worse place the world could ever be
- "war of all against all, in which the life of man is solitary, poor, nasty, brutish and short."
- A *Lord of the Flies* Situation
- By seeking to maximize self-interest, everyone is going to be worse off.
- To escape from the state of nature, two of the following things are necessary
	- **Beneficial rule** that require cooperation
	- **An enforcer** who ensures that these rules are obeyed.
- Give up freedoms in exchange for cooperation.

```ad-warning
The problem with these agreements is that there will always be those who break the promises.
```ad-check
title: Solution
A strong body is necessary to give an excellent reason wby to keep their word.
```

## The Advantages of Contractarianism

### Benefit One

```ad-summary
title: Advantage One
It justiifies the content of the basic moral rules. Rules that are meant to govern social cooperation.
```

**Veil of Ignorance**:
- Created by John Rawls
- An imaginary device that erases all knowledge of your distinctive traits
- Only keeps basic human needs and removes everything else.
- Keeps everyone on equal footing so that choices are completely fair.
- Under these conditions, what rules would rational people select?
- Used to define contractarianism's central moral rules:
	- Rational, self-interested people, free of coercion, would agree to obey them, so long as others are willing to obey them too.

```ad-note
Cooperation rules must be designed to benefit everyone, not just a few. Mutual benefit over benefit of one person/group over another.
```

### Benefit Two

```ad-summary
It is able to explain the objectivity of morality. Anyone can be mistaken aobut what morality reuqires and that personal opinion does not make the final choice.
```

```ad-important
Morality is a set of rules that would be agreed to by people who are very like us, only more rational and wholly free, and who are selecting terms of cooperation that will benefit each and every one of them.
- Allows for moral rules ot be argued and denied.
```

### Benefit Three

```ad-summary
Explains why it is sometimes acceptable to break the moral rules.
- Morality is based on the cooperative living and falls to the way-side as it approaches the state of nature.
- "Do not kill, cheat, intimidate, so long as others are obeying this rule as well."
```

## The Role of Consent

A rules of a contract can also be applied to a commitment as well.
- We are morally **required** to keep our promises in terms of the social contract

```ad-important
The social contract fixes our basic moral duties only to those that have **consented** to them.
- We are mroally required to live up to the standards that free, rational people would accep tas the terms of their cooperative living.
```

## Disagreement among the Contractors

### Based on Rawls' Teachings
To solve a dispute when someone disagrees with one another, it is important to remove everyone's distinguishing features in the situation. If this is the case then, **there is no reason to expect any disagreement**

### Based on Hobbes' Teachings

Believes that moral rules are those that we, situated as we are, would rational agree to, provided of course that others would agree to live by them as well.
