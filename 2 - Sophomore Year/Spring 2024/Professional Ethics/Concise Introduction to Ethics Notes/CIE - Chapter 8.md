# Social Contract Theory/Contractarianism

It tells us that laws are just if, and only if, they reflect the terms of a social contract.

```ad-summary
Actions are morally right just bvecause they are permitted by rules that free, equal, and rational people would gree to live by, on the condition that others obey these rules as well.
```

## The Background of the Social Contract Theory

Goes back to ancient Greece in the *Republic* era when Plato's brothers asked Socrates about the social contract view.
- Argued that to fight against the need for having the most power over everyone, that it is important to conditionally curb self-interest and cooperate with each other when necessary.
- Social contract theory tells us that we each do best for ourselves by agreeing to limit the direct pursuit of self-interest and accept a bargain that gets us a pretty decent life.
- Keeps us from both an absolute glamorous life and one that is terrible.

## The Prisoner's Dilemma

```ad-note
We each want as much of the scarce resources in life. We try get as much as rationally reasonable in order to prevent it in other people's lives.
```

	- If one snitches to the other, the one gets out scot-free
