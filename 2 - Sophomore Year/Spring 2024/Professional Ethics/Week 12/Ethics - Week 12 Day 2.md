# Bok: Qualified Confidentiality

- Permissible to disclose what the client consents to give away.
- Duty of beneficence (general) to prevent hard to 3rd party *can* outweigh duty of confidentiality to client, provide:
  
  1. Goal of preventing hard to 34d part is practically achievable.
  2. Harm to 3rd party if no disclosure would be greater than harm to client if disclosure
  3. NO alternative means to prevent harm that are morally preferable to disclosure (last resort)
  4. Choose *least* means of disclosure to prevent harm (to protect client autonomy as far as possible)
  5. Inform client of disclosure and act to mitigate potential harm to client (duty of beneficence to client.)

# Kipnis: Unqualified Confidentiality

- *NOT* permissible to disclose without client consent **with no exceptions**
- Duty of beneficence to 3rd party does **NOT** justify breaching confidentiality with client.
- Think about the implications of qualified confidentiality
	- It counteracts the goal of preventing harm by defeating the purpose of the disclosure
	- Argues that the professional better fulfils that duty to the third party by keeping confidentiality with client

1. If Prof discloses without consent, it endangers trust, deters disclosure and less therapy opportunity. Increases the probability of harm.
2. If professional warns client of potential disclosure without consent, which leads to less trust, more guarded, less disclose. Which decreases the knowledge of potential harms and increase the probability of harms.
