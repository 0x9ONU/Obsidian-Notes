- Kant's Principle of Universalizability

```

# Kantianism

## Principle of Universalizability - A Rule about Moral Rules

An action is morally permissible/acceptable if and only if its maxim is universalizable
- If the maxim is universalizable, then the action is morally permissible/acceptable.
- If the action is morally permissible, then the maxim is universalizable.

```ad-warning
If the maxim is *not* universalizable, then the action is *not* morally permissible/acceptable.
```

### Gloss on Kant's Principle

It is always morally wrong to make a moral exception for oneself or of others.
- To act by a rule different form the rule for everyone else (exemption)
- To threat someone by a rule different than the rule of everyone else (exclusion)
$$Morality \Rightarrow Fairness + Consistency$$
## Imperatives

**Hypothetical Imperatives**: Commands us to do what is necessary to achieve our goals

**Categorical Imperative:** Command us to do what is morally necessary apart from goals/results

```ad-important
Kant believes that **all** moral duties are categorical imperatives.
- Applies and Appeals to us jsut because we are rational, free-willed beings.
```

## Universalizability Test

1. Formulate Maxim Clearly - What you propose to do and why you propose doing it.
2. Imagine a world in which everyone supports your maxim and acts according to it. 
3. Ask: Would I still be able to achieve my goal in such a world?

## Kant's Two Test Questions:

**Question 1: Could I will my maxim to become a universal law?**

*If yes*, It is a possible moral universe. Then, ask **Would I will my maxim to become a universal law?** This will be no AS the will is self-contradicting. That means that a law is willed for one and a different one for others. This means it is a flexible duty.

*If no,* Universalized maxim is self defeating or self-contradicting. Which, cannot be a law, is an impossible law of morals, which is strict duty.
