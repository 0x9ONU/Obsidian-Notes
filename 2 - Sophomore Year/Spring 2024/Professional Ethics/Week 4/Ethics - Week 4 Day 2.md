# Principe of Humanity

```ad-summary
title: Definition

Always treat a human being (oneself included) as an end, never as a *mere* means.
```

It is always wrong to treat a human being as if they were **NOT** a rational, free-willed being - as if they were *merely* a thing (tool, object).

**Treat as an end**: With respect for a person's *intrinsic* value and their *reason* and *autonomy*

**Threat as a mere means:** *Circumvent their reason* and manipulate their freedom
- Force, fraud, deception, coercion, etc.

```ad-warning
We can treat poeple as a means to an end **IF** both parties know each other's motives.
```
