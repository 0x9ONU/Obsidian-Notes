# Benevolent Lies

Kant argues that truth-telling is a strict/necessary duty, limited by no expediency: Truthfulness in statements that cannot be avoided is the moral duty for every person, no matter the disadvantage to oneself or others. It is never morally permissible to lie, no matter the motive. Even if a lie does not harm any particular person, it still undercuts universal law and thus weakens moral duty in general.

However, Kant also maintains that every person has a duty of beneficence, to help others according to one's ability and opportunity.

Therefore, is it ever morally permissible to lie from a benevolent motive, to help others -say, to protect someone from danger?
