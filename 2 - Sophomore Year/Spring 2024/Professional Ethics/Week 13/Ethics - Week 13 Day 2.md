## Arguments for The Right to Object

**Pharmacists can and should exercise independent judgement**
- Pharmacists are professionals on par with physicians and nurses.
- Physicians and Nurses have long enjoyed a right of objection that is recognized by society and included in their codes of ethics
- Therefore, pharmacists should have the right of objection on par with physicians and nurses

**Professionals should not forsake their morals as a condition of employment**:
 - The implicit contract through society and professionals allows:
	 - Professionals to practice their profession in accord with their ideals
	 - HC professionals exercise choice in selecting patients and their treatments (except for emergencies)
- Pharmacists should be able to practice the profession in accord with their ideals.

**Conscientious objection is integral to democracy**
- Citizens in a democracy have right to refuse civic duties
- Professionals retain their rights as citizens when they enter their profession.
- Pharmacists retains the right of CO when they enter their profession.

## Arguments against the Right of Object

**Pharmacists choose to enter a profession bound by fiduciary duties**
- Pharmacists enter profession voluntarily and so undertake obligations to their patients.
- Pharmacist first duty to a patient is a fiduciary duty of care $\rightarrow$ DO NO HARM
- The pharmacists autonomy is limited by their limited duty to the patient.
- Therefore, when a pharmacist's objection would directly harm a patient's health, then duty of care override the right of objection

**Pharmacists' objection significantly affect patients' health**
- Pharmacists may object but may not obstruct patient access to care.
- When a pharmacist objection would greatly restrict a patient's access to care or pose a heavy burden on a patient, then right of objection must yield to patient's right to care.

**Refusal has great potential for abuse and discrimination**
- A right of objection is never an excuse for discrimination.
- A pharmacist may not evoke conscience to justify discriminating against a patient on the basis of sex, race, religion, sexuality, etc.
