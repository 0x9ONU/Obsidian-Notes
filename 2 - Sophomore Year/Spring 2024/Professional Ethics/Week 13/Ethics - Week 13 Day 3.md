# Davis' View on Objection

- CO by Healthcare professionals is permissible, provided that:
	- It would leave the patient no worse off medically than if the patient had never met the professional int he first place.
	- The living professional can take extra steps - provide "restitution" - to ensure that the patient is *not* left worse off medically (e.g, refer/transfer)

```ad-note
ONLY Conditional when the objection would leave the patient medically worse off (unlike Cantor and Baum which makes it unconditional)
```
