# Ford Pinto Case:

## Ethical Issues

- Did Ford have a moral duty to inform its potential customers of the design flaw and the safety issue? Was Ford in the moral right/wrong to *not* inform...?
- Was Ford in the moral right/wrong to proceed to production knowing of the safety issue? Did they have a moral obligation to fix before production?
- Was Ford in the moral right/wrong to continue selling the Pinto after the crash results in real life.
- Where they in the moral right/wrong to mislead the government about its own test results.
- Is it ethically acceptable to put a" "cost" on a human life?
- Who should have the right to determine the level of safety in consumer products?
- Were the engineers in the moral right/wrong for presenting the design knowing the safety issues?

## Utilitarianism Questions

1. Would a utilitarian be in favor of using cost-benefit analysis? Why or why not?
- Does money equal happiness/well-being
2. According to Utilitarianism, would Ford be in the moral right/wrong by selling the Pinto to consumers without fixing the rear-end design flaw? Why or why not?
- No
3. According to Utilitarianism, should Ford have informed the public about the design flaw? Why or why not?

**Ethical Arguments *against* using C/B analysis to decide whether or not to fix a design flaw affecting public safety:**

1. When the fix cost is low, benefit must be priority
2. When lives are at stake, using CB analysis put lives at risk...
3. Whne all costs are not counted, CB analys hs plto???
