| ----------- | ---------------------------------- | -------------- |
| Good        | - More money to support his family<br>- Less stress in job security<br>- Wife and kids life is improved<br>- Pay off student debt<br>- Secures a job that works around his disabilities<br>- Lead to better job opportunities<br>- Might be able to affect the research to reduce unintended harms. | - Find a job more suitable for him<br>- Leaves the job open for another better-suited candidate<br>- At peace with himself morally<br>-                 |
| Bad         | - Goes against his moral convictions<br>- Supporting war & chemical warfare<br>- Unhappy with his work<br>- Less time with his kids<br>- Future people might get hurt by chemical weapons<br>- The only way to succeed is to advance the research. Could lead to him getting fired                                   | - Children will not be  getting adequate care<br>- The research will continue anyway regardless if he takes the job<br>- Wife will continue working against her best wishes<br>- Still going to have student debt<br>- Future people might get hurt by chemical weapons <br>-                 |
