# Consequentialism

An action that is **morally required** just because it produces the best *overall* results.
1. What is intrinsically good?
2. What is intrinsically bad?
3. Determine options open to you.
4. For each option, determine *net balance* of value: $\Sigma$ good - $\Sigma$ bad
5. Pick action with *greatest* net balance $\rightarrow$ "optimific" choice/moral duty

```ad-warning
- **Optimific Choice** Does not equal the maximal good or minimizing bad. You have to maximize the good minus the bad
- Just choosing any action with *positive* netbalance/utility is *not* necessarily morally right.
- Sometimes, choosing aciton with *negative* net balance/utility is morally *required*
- Options - available + feasible to *you*
	- Can include doing nothing or no change
- Must consider options + outcomes *im*partially - cannot privilage oneself.
```
# Act Utilitarianism

1. Well-being/happiness
2. Faring poorly/*un*happiness
3. Options
4. For each option, determine *not utility*: $\sum$ happiness - $\sum$ unhappiness
	1. must considered **EVERYONE** affect + weigh everyone's happiness equally
5. **Principle of Utility**: An action is **MORALLY REQUIRED** if and only if it does more to improve overall well-being than any other action you *could* have done in the circumstances.

# George's Scenario

| Good OR Bad | Take Job                           | Continue As is |
| ----------- | ---------------------------------- | -------------- |
| Good        | - More money to support his family<br>- Less stress in job security<br>- Wife and kids life is improved<br>- Pay off student debt<br>- Secures a job that works around his disabilities<br>- Lead to better job opportunities<br>- Might be able to affect the research to reduce unintended harms. | - Find a job more suitable for him<br>- Leaves the job open for another better-suited candidate<br>- At peace with himself morally<br>-                 |
| Bad         | - Goes against his moral convictions<br>- Supporting war & chemical warfare<br>- Unhappy with his work<br>- Less time with his kids<br>- Future people might get hurt by chemical weapons<br>- The only way to succeed is to advance the research. Could lead to him getting fired                                   | - Children will not be  getting adequate care<br>- The research will continue anyway regardless if he takes the job<br>- Wife will continue working against her best wishes<br>- Still going to have student debt<br>- Future people might get hurt by chemical weapons <br>-                 |
