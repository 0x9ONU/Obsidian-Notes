# Utilitarianism
## Mill's Theory of Utilitarianism
**Greatest Happiness Principle:** Actions are (morally) right in proportion as they tend to promote happiness, (morally) wrong (in proportion) as they tend to produce the reverse of happiness.
- Happiness = pleasure + absence of pain
- Unhappiness = pain + privation of pleasure

### Moral Rule Examples:
| Dos     | Don'ts |
| ------- | ------ |
| Kind    | Kill   |
| Help    | Crime  |
| Respect | Deceive       |
| Honest        | Cheat       |
## Attractions
1. **Impartiality** - Everyone's well-being counts equally. Basic fairness to ethics.
2. **Justify ordinary, common moral rules**
3. **Able to restore moral conflicts** 
4. **Moral Flexibility**
	- No moral rule is absolute
	- No action is absolutely right or wrong
	- Any common moral rule can be violated to maximize utility
	- Utility principle justifies moral rules **AND** exceptions to rules.
5. **Expansive Moral Community** - "All Sentient Creatures"

## Difficulties
1. **Utility Principle** is complex to use in practice to make moral decision
	- UP is standard of morality, but does not need to be used as a decision procedure.
2. UP is *very* morally demanding
	- Requires us to act to achieve "optimific" results. Failure to do so is acting immorally
	- Requires self-sacrifice sometimes.
	- Moral duty = always do the best you can
3. Impartiality
	- No distinction between my children and your children
		- I must give your children equal consideration
	- No distinction between deserving + undeserving, or oppressor to oppressed, offender or victim.
		- Their interests count equally
4. UP sometimes requires violating justice. rule of law, due process, equal protection
