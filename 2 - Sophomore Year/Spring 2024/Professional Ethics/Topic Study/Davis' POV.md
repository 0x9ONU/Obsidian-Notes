## Introduction

- There is such a thing as an ethics of quitting. *With qualifications* the doctor may refuse a patient's request.
- Only do so if the patient is not left worse off than before.
- Restitution approach
	- Whenever refusal also needs a referral to someone else

## The Restitution Approach

- Suggests that a doctor can solve a conscience case by terminating or curtailing the relationship.
	- The relationship is to end completely or limit it so that a certain procedure is not available in the relationship
- Based around two premises:
	- If you are not this patient's doctor, you need not do anything for this patient.
	- If this patient of some *other* doctor, you have no right to interfere with what they do.
- ==To justify interference with a patient's actions, the action must be *sufficiently immoral* $\star$
- There are some cases where you are morally justified in interfering with another person's wrongful act.
- In other cases, even if the act is wrongful, you are **NOT** morally justified in interfering with it.
- **ARGUEMNT FOR A QUALIFIED RIGHT OF CONSCIENTIOUS REFUSAL:**
	- If you are not this patient's doctor, you need not do anything for this patient
	- If this patient is the patient of some *other* doctor, you have no right to interfere with what they do, unless what they do is sufficiently wrong.
	- There, in any case where premises 1 and 2 are met (and their expectations are not met), you do not have to provide the requested procedure, but you may not stop the patient form getting that procedure elsewhere.
	- Therefore, if you can transform your existing relationship with a patient into a sufficiently close approximation of what would have happened had the patient gone to some other doctor, then you do not have to provide the procedure, but you may not stop the patient from getting the procedure done elsewhere.
