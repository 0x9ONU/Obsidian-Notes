## Happiness and Virtue

- Ethics aims to create a world where humans flourish, which means living well and doing good.
	- $Happiness \rightarrow highest good$
- Happiness depends on good character:
	- Constellation of virtues that operate together in deliberating, choosing, and acting
- Good character is *necessary* for happiness but **not sufficient**
	- Human flourishing depend son material goods and social goods as well as moral goods virtues.

## What are Virtues

**Stable Dispositions** to perceive, feel, deliberate and choose well concerning pleasures and pains

Involve both rational and emotional capacities a human being needs to function optimally in performing that distinctively human activity - deliberting and choosing actions:
- Accurate perception of situation
- Fitting emotional response
- Nobel motive for action
- Reasoned deliberation
- Willing choice of appropriate action

When one *functions optimally* as a human being, one deliberates and chooses such that one's actions:
- Do right and well in the activity *excellence*
- Do right and well in relation to others *respect*
- Do right and well in relation to oneself *integrity*

## How do we become Virtuous

Right action $\Leftrightarrow$ good character (virtuous circle/cycle)

Every deliberately chosen activity produces character
- For better (virtue) or for worse (vice)

Producing good character requires choosing right actions and performing them well
- Could miss mark in two ways: 
	- Wrong actions
	- Right actions done poorly

To become virtuous (from good character) we must act as if we were virtuous by choosing actions as the virtuous person would choose and act:
- Deliberately chose, with knowledge of right/wrong
- Rightly motivated, for its own sake (b/c it is good)
- Consistently performed, repeatedly in varied circumstances
## Virtues, Pleasures, and Pains

- Every activity is accompanied by pleasure and pain
- Humans, as animal beings, have natural inclinations toward pleasure and natural aversions away from pain.
- Moral excellence, as  a virtue, concerns choosing well regarding pleasures and pains
- Thus, becoming virtuous requries *moral education* regarding pleasrues and pains
	- What to take pleasure and be pained by
- Pleasure/pain in actions indicate states of character

Fully virtuous person: Habitually does the right thing , for the right reason and with right motive - and takes satisfaction/enjoyment (pleasure) in doing so

Continent Person: Usually does right thing but, does not enjoy it PAINED.
