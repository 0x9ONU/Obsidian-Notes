# Death Row Doctor - Issues

1. Is a physician participating in an execution practicing medicine?
   - To Rosemond Case
   - If not, then medical licensing boards have no jurisdiction.

   - AMA - NO
   - Musso - Yes
   - Alternative Argument
3. Is a physician's participation in an execution consistent with the character of a good doctor and the practice of good medicine?
   - Clip
4. Is a physician's participation in executions compatible with the social purpose of the medical license and preserving the public's trust in the medical profession

## Arguments

### AMA (Against)

**Position**: By participating in an execution, a physician acts unethically by violation of the medical-ethical principle of "Do No Harm" (Nonmaleficence)

**Premises**:
1. Execution causes death and thus irreparable harm to the prisoner
2. Acts which cause harm one morally permissible provided the DDE is satisfied
3. Lethal injection fails to satisfy at least some of the DDE, intentionality, and proportionality criteria.
4. Therefore, the physician's participation is morally impermissible. 

## Musso (For)

**Position**: A physician participating in an execution acts ethically by providing compassionate care to the patient/prisoner

**Premises**:
1. The role of the physician in executions is one of "end of life"
2. The prisoner being executed is in an end of life situation.
3. The prisoner dying from a court order is a similar to a patient dying of an incurable cancer
4. The prisoner has a moral interest similar to that of a patient - avoiding unnecessary suffering.
5. Therefore, just as a physician has a proper role in relation to the patient, so the physician has the proper role in relation to the prisoner.
