| YES        | - If no mandate, then more likely ONU could spread Covid to the community & put people at medical risk.<br>- ONU Students would be better protected form Covid, which leads to less missed classes and Covid shut downs<br>- ONU could avoid losing potential students who are seeing a vaccinated campus | - ONU already requires other vaccines for attendance.<br>- COVID is relevant-ways like these diseases. It is Contagious + Serious<br>- COVID vaccine is similar in safety + efficacy.<br>- Therefore... | - A Mandate would do good by increasing safety for the college and the Ada community. Prevents Harm and protects the vulnerable.<br>- Utility $\rightarrow$ Mandate would maximize difference between pleasure and pain. | - Safety of students is one of ONU ideals/core values<br>- A mandate would uphold safety $\rightarrow$ more ONU in direction of ideal |
| NO         | - ONU could lose profit from new/current students who want to avoid the mandate/vaccine <br>- ONU could avoid PR problems from those critical of the vaccine. Reputation could suffer.<br>- Could be less effective if it was on a by-choice basis.                                                       | - ONU does not mandate for the annual flu shot<br>- Covid is similar to the flu<br>- Flu shot is similar in safety + efficacy<br>- Therefore...                                                         | - A person should have the right to make the choice of getting a vaccine. A mandate would infringe on that right. Therefore, the mandate would violate autonomy.<br>-                                                    | - A mandate could infringe on the diversity in the community.<br>- Could exclude those members.                                                     |
