# Ross's Pluralism

```ad-summary
**Absolutism** - Moral rules are absolute-never permissibly broken
$$\space$$
**Monism** - One ultimate, fundamental rule
```

| Theory             | Absolutist   | Monist       |
| ------------------ | ------------ | ------------ |
| Utilitarianism     | $\checkmark$ | $\checkmark$ |
| Kantianism         | $\checkmark$ | $\checkmark$ |
| Contractarianism   | $\not$       | $\checkmark$ |

## Prima Facie Duties

- A PFD is an excellent, non-absolute, permanent reason to do or not to do something.
- Each PFD is of fundamental importance. No fixed ranking of moral rules.
- PFD is a permanent reason that partly determines whether an action is, all things considered, morally required. Always important for moral reasoning but not always sufficient to determine one's moral duty.

```

## Case: "Beg, Borrow or Steal"

1. Which PFD's are relevant in the situation?
2. Which, if any, PFDs are in conflict? How?
3. If PFDs conflict, which is/are **more/most** important (weightier) in this situation.
4. All tings considered, what is B's moral duty - what does she have the strongest moral reason(s) to do?
