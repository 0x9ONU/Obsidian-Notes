# Veracity

## Initial Questions

1. Why is truth-telling a *moral* matter? What is at stake, morally, in whether I tell you the truth?
2. Should *professionals* in relating to clients be held to the higher, same, or lower standard of veracity as applied to ordinary situations? Why?

## Bok's Viewpoint

A **lie** is an intentionally deceptive message that is stated.

A **deception** is to mislead someone to believe what you do *not* believe

## Lying and Choice

- Lying breaks down trust in society.
- Undermines Decision Making. Manipulates Choices
- Form of Coercion akin to violence
- Distributes power from the deceived to the liar.

## Perspective of Deceived

- People that have been lied to often feel cheated, robbed, or manipulated out of a choice
- Rethink pervious choices 
- Distrust $\rightarrow$ Wariness of Lies

## Perspective of Liars

- Want to be told the truth, but they want an exception for themselves.
- Lying could create need for more lies
- Liars often discount future negative consequences in favor of short-term gains.
- Liars usually weight benefits for self more than harm to others.

## Principle of Veracity

- Lying is not morally neutral - it is inherently bad
- Initial weight against lies and presumption in favor of truth-telling
- The burden of proof is on the liar because of his special privilege

## Excuses

- Not a lie - it is just a joke
- Unintentional - Never meant to mislead
- Lie - but moral reasons to justify it

## Justification

- Moral reason to justify a lie must be capable of being made public
- Test of publicity - Reasonable persons
