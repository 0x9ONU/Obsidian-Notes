# Veracity

## Initial Questions

1. Why is truth-telling a *moral* matter? What is at stake, morally, in whether I tell you the truth?
2. Should *professionals* in relating to clients be held to the higher, same, or lower standard of veracity as applied to ordinary situations? Why?

## Bok's Viewpoint

A **lie** is an intentionally deceptive message that is stated.

A **deception** is to mislead someone to believe what you do *not* believe
