# Journalists Ethics

## Journalism's "Mission" Statement - The Service to Society

The purpose of journalism is to ensure free exchange of information that is accurate, fair  and through to promote public enlightenment, support justice, and democracy.
- To fulfill its mission, journalism must be **credible**. Journalists must be **trustworthy**

```ad-example
title: Attributes of Good Journalism
- Accurate
- Thorough
- Fair
- Independent
- Impartial
- Objective
- Not harmful
- Accountable
- Transparent
```

## Ethical Framework #1 - Not to Help

- First duty of a journalist is to fulfill their special professional-role obligations aka. the strongest reasons to act.
- The general moral duty of beneficence is a secondary duty.
- Usually, the secondary duty is compatible with the primary duty.
	- BUT, when they conflict, the primary duty takes precedence in most cases.
- The secondary duty can override the primary duty in *exceptional* circumstances under certain conditions:
	- There is potential for immediate harm if journalist does not intervene.
	- Help no more/longer than necessary to prevent harm.

### Reasons not to Help

1. Good journalism is itself **beneficial** to society and to those in the situation. Good journalist fulfills general moral obligation of **beneficence** just by being a good journalist.
2. Intervening in a situation to help would change the situation and alter the outcome. Helping changes the story and makes the journalist the story. It distorts the story and creates a grandstanding situation, which undermines the credibility and trustworthiness stated in the mission.
3. Helping could compromise objectivity or impartiality.
4. Giving aid to those in need is not a journalists job as they are not trained to give help. May lead to unintentional harm.
## Ethical Framework #2 - To Help

- The first duty of journalists is to fulfill the general moral duties of a human being.
- The special professional-role obligations of journalism are secondary duties.
- Usually, the secondary duties are compatible with the primary duty.
- When they conflict, the primary duty takes precedent if the general moral duty is sufficiently strong in the situation.
  
### Reason to Help

1. General moral duty of beneficence. Saving lives is a human's #1 moral duty.
2. Not helping would discredit the profession in the public's eye. Not helping would give the impression of not caring, which makes the profession seem not **trustworthy**.
