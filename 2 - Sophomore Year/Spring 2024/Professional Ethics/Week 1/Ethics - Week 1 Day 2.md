| Questions that can, at least potentially, be adequately or completely answered by empirical inquiry, data analysis, etc. |  |

## Challenger Case

```ad-warning
- Be careful of oversimplfying a case down to one or two questions due to mental biases.
- Do not downplay the significance of timing when putting into other shoes. (Retrospective Bias)
	- The outcome would not have been known until it happened in the future.
```

| Technical | Ethical |
| ---- | ---- |
| How will the o-rings respond to the temperatures predicted for launch? | Does the issue with the -rings violated any safety standards? |
| Was the data significant enough to determine whether to launch or not? |  |
| What would be the cost and consequences of delaying the launch? What would NASA lose? |  |
| Would Morton Thiokol lose the contract if they recommend against the launch? |  |
