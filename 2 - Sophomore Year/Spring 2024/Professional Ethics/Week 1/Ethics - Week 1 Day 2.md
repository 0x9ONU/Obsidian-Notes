# Ethical Issues vs. Technical Issues

| Technical | Ethical |
| ---- | ---- |
| Questions that can, at least potentially, be adequately or completely answered by empirical inquiry, data analysis, etc. | Questions that CANNOT be answered adequately or completely by empirical inquiry, data analysis, etc. Yet the facts of the matter may be relevant to deciding the right/wrong of the matter. |

## Challenger Case

```ad-warning
- Be careful of oversimplfying a case down to one or two questions due to mental biases.
- Do not downplay the significance of timing when putting into other shoes. (Retrospective Bias)
	- The outcome would not have been known until it happened in the future.

| How will the o-rings respond to the temperatures predicted for launch?                | Does the issue with the -rings violated any safety standards?  What is the acceptable risk versus the unacceptable risk? |
| Was the data significant enough to determine whether to launch or not?                | Who gets to participate in making the final decision? Designers, Financial Backers/Stackholders, astronauts, NASA        |
| What would be the cost and consequences of delaying the launch? What would NASA lose? | Is it acceptable to launch humans into space with an uncertainty with potential catastrophic risk?                       |
| Would Morton Thiokol lose the contract if they recommend against the launch?          | Who should be held responsible in the case of success or risk?                                                           |

# Engineering vs. Management

```ad-important
Management has to go with what they do know and has to accept the risks that goes with keeping the launch or delaying the launch.
