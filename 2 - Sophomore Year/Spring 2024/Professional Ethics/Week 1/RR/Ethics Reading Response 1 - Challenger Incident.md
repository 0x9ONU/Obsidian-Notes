#ProfessionalEthics

# Question:

Read/listen to the three NPR reports on Roger Boisjoly and view the short video clip from _Challenger--__The Untold Story_.  Now put yourself in the position of the Morton Thiokol engineers involved in the decision whether to recommend launching the Space Shuttle Challenger as scheduled.

(a) This decision involved **both** technical and ethical questions. Identify one _technical_ question **and** one _ethical_ question involved in this decision. Keep in mind that the technical and ethical questions may be connected (that is, answering an ethical question may depend on having an answer to a technical question) and that the ethical questions may be implicit (assumed but not named) in the details of the case. 

(b) Under pressure from NASA to approve the launch, the Morton Thiokol senior vice-president told the MT vice-president of engineering, who was undecided, "You have to take off your engineering hat and put on your management hat." What do you think he meant by that?

# Notes

## Article

Roger Boisjoly
- Booster rocket engineer at NASA
- Worked on the Challenger
- One of two sources that NPR quoted after the incident
- Fought to stop the launch
The Problem
- Boisjoly found data that indicated that a launch would not be possible because of the booster's thrust.
- Bad elastic seals at the joints that were compounded by the cold weather
	- 30 degree Fahrenheit weather
	- Would lead to an explosion if they failed
- Bolisjoly and Zwerdling both caught this issue before hand
The Debate
- Thiokol managers agreed with the engineers about delaying the launch.
- NASA officials pushed against that recommendation and even ridiculed them for wanting to push it back.
- Nasa convinced Thiokol to overrule the engineers and would continue with the launch anyways 
The Aftermath
- The shuttle start going up without a problem for around a minute, then blew up in the atmosphere
- The entire crew died from the incident.
- Boisjoly  
	- left disabled due to the depression caused by the event.
	- Failed to sue Thiokol and NASA
	- Was ostracized by the science community and his colleagues
	- Started speaking out against the decision and had talk sessions with future engineers to explain the importance of ethics
## Video

- First time a company stood up to NASA for a launch
- Happened 13 hours before the launch
- The o-rings loose their elastic properties at cold temperature
	- The primary and secondary seals will not work
- Thiokol 
- NASA response
	- "When do you want me to launch? Next April??"
	- Said that you are messing with the launch schedule with the new found data.
- Kennedy and Marshal Discussioth
	- Marshal branch said that he was surprised, but would not go against the contractor
	- Did not want to launch
- Senior Vice President
	- Said we need to make a management decision
	- "We are spinning the wheels with no ground"
	- Ultimately swayed the conversation against moving the launch date 
- Thompson, an engineer, and Boisjoly went through everything that they found one more time
- Management voted for the launch regardless
	- "Take off your engineering hat, and put on your management hat"
	- Said that the data is inconclusive

# Answer

In the debate Morton Thiokol and NASA over postponing the launch of the Challenger, there are multiple technical and ethical questions that were brought up during their discussions. On the technical side, the party against launching the rocket questioned that due to the o-rings on the space shuttle, would it be okay to launch the rocket in the lowest temperatures recorded during a launch. However, on the ethical side, there were concerns about the safety of the personnel that would be flying on the rocket. Furthermore, when the senior vice-president of Morton Thiokol told the MT vice-president to "take off your engineering hat and put on your management hat", he was trying to convince his colleague to change his viewpoint on the issue to his. For example, instead of thinking about how the o-rings could fail, he wanted the MT vice-president to think about how much it would cost their contract and reputation with NASA, which could ultimately bring down their company overtime. Different answers to technical and ethical questions vary based on someone's current viewpoint, which would turn the entire management of Thiokol against the data provided by Boisjoly.
