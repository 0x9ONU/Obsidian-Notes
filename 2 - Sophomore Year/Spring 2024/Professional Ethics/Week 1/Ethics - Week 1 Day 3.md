# Categories of Right and Wrong

**Wrong**:
- Forgivable: You did wrong, and you are responsible, but you are not beyond mercy
- Excusable: You did wrong, but you were not responsible for what you did or you had a reason to justify what you did
- Tolerable/Toleration: What you did is not right, but is not socially punished

**Right**:
- Permissible/Permission: What you did is not wrong, but is right *only* to the bare minimum; what is permissible to do is permissible to not do ("may")
- Obligatory/Obligation: What is right beyond permissible; what each one owes to others (duty); necessary to being an upright person or doing right by others; what is obligatory to do is not permissible to not do ("ought" or "must" or "shall")
- Excellent/Excellence: What is right beyond obligatory; right to the utmost; what would be best/ideal

## Challenger Case Examples

- Was MT/NASA *in the moral wrong* by allowing/Approving the launch given the risk?
	- Was it ethically *permissible* for MT/NASA to approve the launch
	- Did it violate *beneficence*

- Was NASA in the *moral right/wrong* by not informing the shuttle crew about the risk?
	- Did NASA *violate* the crew's **autonomy**

- Were the MT engineers in the *moral right/wrong* by not voicing their objection and informing NASA that they had been overruled by MT management?
	- Did they have an **ethical duty/obligation** to inform NASA
	- Did the MT engineers fail their **professional-ethical duty** to public safety?
	- Was their silence **excusable/justifiable** due to potential personal costs/consequences?
