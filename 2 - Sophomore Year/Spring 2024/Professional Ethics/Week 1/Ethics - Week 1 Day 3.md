# Categories of Right and Wrong

**Wrong**:
- Forgivable: You did wrong, and you are responsible, but you are not beyond mercy
- Excusable: You did wrong, but you were not responsible for what you did or you had a reason to justify what you did
- Tolerable/Toleration: What you did is not right, but is not socially punished

**Right**:
- Permissible/Permission: What you did is not wrong, but is right *only* to the bare minimum; what is permissible to do is permissible to not do ("may")
- Obligatory/Obligation: What is right beyond permissible; what each one owes to others (duty); necessary to being an upright person or doing right by others; what is obligatory to do is not permissible to not do ("ought" or "must" or "shall")
- Excellent/Excellence: What is right beyond obligatory; right to the utmost; what would be best/ideal
