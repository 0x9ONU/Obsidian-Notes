```ad-note
title: Remember
For the follwoing circuit below:
$$V_{DD} = 10V \Rightarrow V_o =0.689 V \space \& \space I = 931 mA$$
```
![[Electronics - Week 9 Day 1 2024-03-22 13.45.29.excalidraw]]

**However, when you change the $V_{DD}$**

$$V_{DD} = 5V \Rightarrow V_o =0.67 V$$
$$V_{DD} = 15V \Rightarrow V_o =0.7 V$$
