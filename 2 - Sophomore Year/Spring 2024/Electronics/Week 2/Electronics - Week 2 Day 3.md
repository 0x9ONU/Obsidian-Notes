# Amplifiers

**Signal Amplification**: A fundamental signal processing function, that is employed in almost every electronic system.
- Transducers provide weak signals in $\micro v$ or $mv$ range. Reliable processing requires larger magnitude

**Gain** - The ratio of the output signal to the input signal.

```ad-important
An emplifier is **linear**. The gain of the ampliifier must be the same independent of the amplitude of the input signal and the frequency of the input signal.
