$$y = A \sin(kx - \omega t)$$

# Wave Interactions

## Beats

When two frequencies are close together they form a third frequency (beat frequency)

$$f_b = f_1-f_2$$
```ad-example
$f_1 = 220Hz \space \& \space f_2 = 200 Hz \Rightarrow F_b = 20 Hz$
- This happens when you tune instruments. You try to minimize the beat frequency
```

## Diffraction

- Bending of waves around objects

![[diffraction1.jpg]]

![[diagram.png]]



Waves bend around objects better when:
- $\lambda$ is larger
- Object is smaller

```ad-example
Wi-Fi:
Longer wavelength ($12 cm$) - Goes through walls
```

## Resonance

```ad-summary
title: Definition
Occurs when the frequency of the source matches the natural frequency of the object.
```

**Natural Frequency**:
- Every object has a natural frequency of vibration

```ad-example
- Microwaves
	- Low energy waves that resonate at the frequency of water
- Sound boxes
	- Need sound boxes with the same natural frequency
- Bridges Collapsing Due to the Natural Frequency matching the wind
```

## Doppler Effect

```ad-summary
title: Definition
The apparent shift in freuqency due to a moving source. This is true **for all** waves
```

**Equation:**

$$f^\prime = (\frac{v \pm v_o}{v \mp v_s})f_0$$

```ad-note
The signs depends on approaching or going away:
- Approaching means positive on top and negative on bottom ($f^\prime = (\frac{v + v_o}{v - v_s})f_0$)
- Going away means negative on top and positive on bottom ($f^\prime = (\frac{v - v_o}{v + v_s})f_0$)
```
### Example - Truck Approaches (Horn)

![[Physics 2 - Week 13 Day 1 2024-04-22 11.38.22.excalidraw]]

```ad-question
Given:
- $f_0 = 150Hz$
- $V_w = 340 \frac{m}{s}$
- $V_s = 45 \frac{m}{s}$
$$\space$$
Find the new apparent frequency
```


$$f^\prime = f_0(\frac{v_w+v_d}{v_w-v_s}) = 150(\frac{340+0}{340-45})=173 \space Hz$$
### Doppler Effect Due to Light

- Towards means **bluer light**
- Away means **redder light**

**Astronomical Red Shift**:
- Galaxies we see look slightly reddish
- That measn the galaxies are moving away since they are reddish
- That means at some point they were closer, which means the universe should be expanding
- Is one of the main proofs behind the **big bang**
