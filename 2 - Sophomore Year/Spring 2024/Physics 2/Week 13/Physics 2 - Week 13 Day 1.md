$$y = A \sin(kx - \omega t)$$

# Wave Interactions

## Beats

When two frequencies are close together they form a third frequency (beat frequency)

$$f_b = f_1-f_2$$
```ad-example
$f_1 = 220Hz \space \& \space f_2 = 200 Hz \Rightarrow F_b = 20 Hz$
- This happens when you tune instruments. You try to minimize the beat frequency
```

## Diffraction

- Bending of waves around objects

Waves bend around objects better when:
- $\lambda$ is larger
- Object is smaller

```ad-example
Wi-Fi:
Longer wavelength ($12 cm$) - Goes through walls
```

## Resonance

```ad-summary
title: Definition
Occurs when the frequency of the source matches the natural frequency of the object.
```

**Natural Frequency**:
- Every object has a natural frequency of vibration

```ad-example
- Microwaves
	- Low energy waves that resonate at the frequency of water
- Sound boxes
	- Need sound boxes with the same natural frequency
- Bridges Collapsing Due to the Natural Frequency matching the wind
```
