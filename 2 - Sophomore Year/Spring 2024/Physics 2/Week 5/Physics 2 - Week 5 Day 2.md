# Contractarianism

```ad-summary
title: Definition
Actions are morally permissible just because they are permitted by rules that free, equal and rational persons would agree to live by, on the condition that others obey/follow these rules as well.
```

If an action is not permitted by rules that rational persons would agree to live by on the condition that..., then we are morally **required** to not do that action.

# Glaucon's Theory

**Justice**- The midpoint between the extremes (between the best and the worst case)
- Originates as an *agreement*, based on rational **self-interest**.

```ad-example
- I practice justice (keep the agreement) b/c
- I calculate that it is in *my interest* to do so:
- I am more likely to do better for myself by keeping the agreement than by breaking it (as long as others keep it).
```

```ad-note
But no one does justice (keeps the agreement) voluntarily/willingly
```
