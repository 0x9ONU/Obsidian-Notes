# Multi-Lens System

## Telescoping Lenses

## Human Eye

![[images.jpg]]

- Detects Electromagnetic Radiation
- Light hits rods and cones
- Eye detects more than brain can process
- Brain makes stuff up (ignores some, creates some)
- There is a blind spot at the back of the optic nerve where you cannot see anything

**Normal Vision** 20/20

**Near-Sighted/Myopia**
- Can see near
- Cannot see far away
- The eye is either too big
- Lens too strong
- 50% of people
- Corrected by diverging lens

**Far-Sighted/Hyperopia**
- Can see far
- Cannot see near
- Eye is too small
- Lens is too weak
- Corrected with a converging lens

## Colors

Primary colors of light? **(Red, Green Blue)**
- Combine to make white light

Primary colors of paint? (**Magenta, cyan, yellow**)

### Color Reflection Examples

#### Example 1: Blue Shirt in White Light

![[Physics 2 - Week 15 Day 2 2024-05-08 11.32.16.excalidraw]]

- Reflected? BLUE
- Absorbed? Red and Green
- Color of the shirt appears? BLUE

#### Example 2: Blue Shirt in Green Light

![[Physics 2 - Week 15 Day 2 2024-05-08 11.34.16.excalidraw]]

- Reflected? NONE
- Absorbed? Green
- Shirt appears? BLACK

#### Example 3: Red Light on Black Shirt

![[Physics 2 - Week 15 Day 2 2024-05-08 11.35.38.excalidraw]]

- Reflected? None
- Absorbed? Red
- Appears? Black

```ad-note
Black abosrbs most light, which becomes hot. White reflects most light and does not get as hot.
```

### Skin tones?

Why is it backwards?

### Colorblind

- Red green colorblindness affects 10% of males

### Blue Skies

- White light from the sun
- Blue is scattered by the atmosphere - blue sky
	- (blue has shorter wavelength)
- Red and green light gets through, makes the sun seem yellow.

### Sunset

- htie light form the sun
- More atmosphere at sunset
- Blue and green are scattered
- Only red light gets through
