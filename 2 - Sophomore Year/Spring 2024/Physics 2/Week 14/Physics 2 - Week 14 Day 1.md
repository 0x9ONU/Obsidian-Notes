# Plane Mirror

![[Physics - Week 14 Day 1 2024-04-29 11.03.06.excalidraw]]

$$d_o = d_i$$

```ad-warning
Light appears to come from Image. Light is reflect off of mirror.
```

## Examples

### Example 1: Large Mirror in a Store

![[Physics - Week 14 Day 1 2024-04-29 11.06.53.excalidraw]]

```ad-note
Realistically, you only need around 3.5 feet of mirror for the average person.
```

### Example 2: Backwards Letter C

![[Physics - Week 14 Day 1 2024-04-29 11.10.02.excalidraw]]

# Real vs. Virtual Image

**Real Image**:
- Light Rays meet to form image
- Image appears on the screen
- Examples: Projector, Movies, Camera, Converging Lens, Eye

**Virtual Image**:
- Light does not meet at the image
- Image not seen on screen
- Examples: Plane mirror, glasses, etc.

# Spherical/Curved Mirrors

```ad-important
There are two main types:
1. Concave
2. Convex
```

![[Physics - Week 14 Day 1 2024-04-29 11.16.09.excalidraw]]

## Concave Mirrors

**Parallel Rays**

![[Physics - Week 14 Day 1 2024-04-29 11.17.52.excalidraw]]

$$c \Rightarrow \mbox{Center of Curvature}$$
$$f = \frac{1}{2}R$$
$$f \Rightarrow \mbox{Where two Parallel Light Rays Meet}$$

### Image Formation - Ray Diagrams

#### Example - Far from Lens

![[Physics - Week 14 Day 1 2024-04-29 11.22.28.excalidraw]]

```ad-note
This image is:
- Real
- Smaller
- Inverted
```

#### Example - Close to Lens

![[Physics - Week 14 Day 1 2024-04-29 11.25.24.excalidraw]]

```ad-note
- Real
- Larger
- Inverted
```

#### Example - Inside the Focal Point

![[Physics - Week 14 Day 1 2024-04-29 11.27.42.excalidraw]]

```ad-important
If it does not form a real image, trace the reflected ray backwards
```

```ad-note
- Virtual
- Larger
- Upright
```

#### Example - Object At Focal Point

![[Physics - Week 14 Day 1 2024-04-29 11.33.12.excalidraw]]

```ad-warning
The image is at infinity
```

#### Example - Object at Infinity, All the rays are in parallel

![[Physics - Week 14 Day 1 2024-04-29 11.35.14.excalidraw]]

```ad-note
- Light meets at focal point
- Example: Telescope
```

## Convex Mirrors

**Parallel Rays**

![[Physics - Week 14 Day 1 2024-04-29 11.38.19.excalidraw]]

```ad-example
- Curved mirrors in hospitals, corners of stores
```

### Image Formation

#### Example - Far Away

![[Physics - Week 14 Day 1 2024-04-29 11.41.34.excalidraw]]

```ad-note
- Virtual
- Smaller
- Upright
```
#### Example - Close

![[Physics - Week 14 Day 1 2024-04-29 11.43.35.excalidraw]]

```ad-note
- Virutal
- Smaller
- Upright
```
