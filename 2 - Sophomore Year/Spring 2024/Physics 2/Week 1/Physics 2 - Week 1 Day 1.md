# Syllabus 

## Grades

| Assignment        | Percentage |
| ----------------- | ---------- |
| Homework          | 8%         |
| Class Assignments | 12%        |

```ad-important
Homework will be collected every Friday before **2:00pm**, it will be handed into the grader (paper copy)
- One homework grade will be dropped
- Hand in the bold problems. Non-bolded are for practice
```

```ad-warning
Four unexcused missed classes will result in a full 10% grade drop. Five classes would be two letter grades
```

## Study Guides

Has a bunch of practice problems for each test and quiz

# Scientific

All science is based around the utilization of the scientific method
## Scientific Method

- Hypothesis
- Gather Data
- Analyze Data $\rightarrow$ Table $\rightarrow$ Graph $\rightarrow$ Trendline $\rightarrow$ Equation (ex. $y = mx+b \Rightarrow F=ma$ ) $\rightarrow$ Predicts the Future
- Repeat the Previous Steps 

# Electric Charges

## Atoms

Made up of:
- *Electrons*: Negative Charge ($-1.6x10^{-19} C$)
- *Protons*: Positive Charge ($+1.6x10^{-19} C$)
- *Neutron*: No Charge

## Observations

1. Like Charges: Repel
2. Unlike Charges: Attract
3. Neutral Objects: 
	1. Attract both positive and negative objects
	2. Ignore other neutrals
4. Electrons weigh much less than prtons and move much faster
5. Total charge is conserved:
	1. No net charge is ever created or destroyed
	2. ex. Negative charge can *only* be removed by adding a positive charge to neutralize it
6. Smallest charge is: $e = 1.6*10^{-19} C$ (Coulombs)
7. Charge is quantized: $Yes = 1e, 2e, 4e$
8. Everyday objects: Many, Many atoms - many charges
```ad-warning
Charge cannot be decimals 
$$Charge \ne 1.4e, 2.6e$$
```

### Balloon Example

A balloon can stick to a wall for two reasons:
- The Balloon is negative and the  wall is neutral
	- More Realistically polarized (multiple negative and positive charges that are neutral)
- The Balloon is negative and the wall is positive

## Nuclear Atom Experiments

### Rutherford Gold Foil Experiment
- Atomic nucleus is small
- Atoms are mostly empty space
- We are msotly empty space
- Nucleus is a penny at 50 yrd line, electron is a mosquito in the stands

## Materials

**Insulators**: $e-$ not move easily
- Wood, rubber, air, etc.
**Conductors**: $e-$ move easily
- wires, tap water, metals, etc.
**Semiconductors**: Conductance between insulators and conductors
