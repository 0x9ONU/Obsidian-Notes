# Example Calculations

**Calculate $\mu$**

$$\mu = \frac{m}{L}$$
$$\mu = \frac{2.29*10^{-3}}{1.203}$$
$$\mu = 1.9*10^{-3}$$

## Calculate Wavelength ($\lambda$)

**$n = 7$**

$$\lambda = \frac{2L}{n}$$
$$= \frac{2(1.203m)}{7}$$
$$\lambda = 0.344 \space m$$

**$n = 6$**

$$\lambda = \frac{2L}{n}$$
$$= \frac{2(1.203m)}{6}$$
$$\lambda = 0.401 \space m$$

**$n = 5$**

$$\lambda = \frac{2L}{n}$$
$$= \frac{2(1.203m)}{5}$$
$$\lambda = 0.481 \space m$$
**$n = 4$**

$$\lambda = \frac{2L}{n}$$
$$= \frac{2(1.203m)}{4}$$
$$\lambda = 0.602 \space m$$


**$n = 3$**

$$\lambda = \frac{2L}{n}$$
$$= \frac{2(1.203m)}{3}$$
$$\lambda = 0.802 \space m$$


## Calculate Tension ($T$)

**$n=7$**
$$T = mg$$
$$= (0.214)(9.8)$$
$$T=2.1 \space N$$

**$n=6$**
$$T = mg$$
$$= (0.308)(9.8)$$
$$T= 3.0 \space N$$

**$n=5$**
$$T = mg$$
$$= (0.448)(9.8)$$
$$T=4.4 \space N$$

**$n=4$**
$$T = mg$$
$$= (0.698)(9.8)$$
$$T=6.8 \space N$$

**$n=3$**
$$T = mg$$
$$= (1.190)(9.8)$$
$$T=11.7 \space N$$

## Calculate Frequency ($f$)

**$n=7$**

$$f = \frac{1}{\lambda}\sqrt{\frac{T}{\mu}}$$
$$f = \frac{1}{0.344}\sqrt{\frac{(2.1)}{(1.9*10^{-3})}}$$
$$f=96.5 \mbox{ Hz}$$

**$n=6$**

$$f = \frac{1}{\lambda}\sqrt{\frac{T}{\mu}}$$
$$f = \frac{1}{0.401}\sqrt{\frac{(3.0)}{(1.9*10^{-3})}}$$
$$f=96.5 \mbox{ Hz}$$

**$n=5$**

$$f = \frac{1}{\lambda}\sqrt{\frac{T}{\mu}}$$
$$f = \frac{1}{(0.481)}\sqrt{\frac{(4,4)}{(1.9*10^{-3})}}$$
$$f= 123.7\mbox{ Hz}$$

**$n=4$**

$$f = \frac{1}{\lambda}\sqrt{\frac{T}{\mu}}$$
$$f = \frac{1}{(0.602)}\sqrt{\frac{(6.5)}{(1.9*10^{-3})}}$$
$$f= 123.7\mbox{ Hz}$$

**$n=3$**

$$f = \frac{1}{\lambda}\sqrt{\frac{T}{\mu}}$$
$$f = \frac{1}{(0.802)}\sqrt{\frac{(11.7)}{(1.9*10^{-3})}}$$
$$f= 97.8\mbox{ Hz}$$
# Postlab Questions

1. State the instrumental resolution for each measurement device. The measured quantities were: 
   - $L\Rightarrow \pm 0.0005 m$
   - mass of weights $m \Rightarrow \pm 0.0005kg$
   - mass of string. $m \Rightarrow \pm 0.00005 kg$
2. How did you determine $\mu$ in this experiment?

You take the total length of the string and divide it by its mass because it is the mass per unit length of the string

$$\mu = \frac{m}{L}=1.9*10^{-3}$$

3. What frequency does $f$ respresent? Compute a percent difference between the accepted value and the experimental value. (Accepted value: $f = 120 \mbox{ Hz}$)

The frequency represents the frequency of the oscillatory, which is how many times it makes a full movement per second.

$$\mbox{Percent Difference} = \frac{|(120)-(98.52)|}{(98.52)}*100 \% = 17.9\%$$

# Discussion

Overall, unlike the previous few labs, the team hit a few bumps along the way when it came to this experiment. Initially, we had troubles finding the correct number of antinodes and could only find the even values ($n = 7, 5, 4$). However, we realized that we accidentally had the mass of the four waves rather than five, which made us skip two of the required masses. Additionally, we had issues when it came to the bad average, standard deviation, and percent difference. Since the instrumental resolutions are better than this, we primarily blame it incorrectly understanding the maximum amplitude, and in term correct amount of mass, for the pulley. This threw off some of the calculations when it came to the frequency. However, we need to further investigate how we got no higher than $f = 100 \mbox{ Hz}$, which is twenty hertz under the expected value.
