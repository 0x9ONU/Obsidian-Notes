# Things to Remember
- Right hand rule one:
	- Fuck the magnetic field
	- Point at the velocity
	- Thumb shows the resultant force
- Right hand rule two:
	- Magnetic field curls around the current's thumb

## Constants

**Electron**

$$Q=1.6*10^{-19} C, m = 9.11*10^{-31} kg$$
# Equations

**Force Due to Charge in Magnetic Field**
$$F_B^\to = Qv^\to \otimes b^\to$$

```ad-important
Remember cross products:
$$A^\to  \otimes B^\to = \begin{bmatrix}\hat i & \hat j & \hat k \\ A_x & A_y & A_z \\ B_x & B_y & B_z\end{bmatrix} = (A_yB_z - A_Z B_y)\hat i - (A_xB_z - A_zB_x)\hat j + (A_xB_y - A_yB_x)\hat k$$
```

**Charge in Circular Motion Field**

$$r = \frac{mv}{qB}$$

**Velocity Due to Charge in Magnetic Field with GRAVITY**

 $$v = \frac{mg}{qB}$$
**Magnetic Forces on Currents**

$$F^\to = IL^\to \otimes B^\to$$
