# Generators and Motors

## Generators

- Makes Electricity
- Turns work into Electricity
- Moving metal wires in a B-Field makes a Voltage ($e_{inf}$)
- Turn coil in a B-field. Induces and $e_{inf}$. This makes a current.

**Energy Sources?**
- Wind, water, steam (coal, gas, nuclear, etc.)

## Motors

- Do Work
- Electricity turns into work
- Electricity can make a $B_1$-Field repelled by an external $B_2$-Field
- use an electro-magnet that spins when placed in an external B-Field

# Inductors ($L$)

- Small Solenoid
- Measured in Henrys
- Stores B-Field Energy in Circuit
- Mostly used in AC Circuits

## Equations

$$L = \frac{N \Phi_B}{I} \space (\mbox{Self Inductance})$$
$$L = N_o n^2 Al$$
$$V_L(e)=-L\frac{dI}{dt} \space (\mbox{Inductor Voltage Drop})$$

## Derivation - Inductance of a Solenoid $\star$

### Sketch

![[Physics 2 - Week 10 Day 3 2024-04-06 18.12.02.excalidraw]]

$$n = \frac{N}{L}$$

$$L = \frac{N \Phi_B}{I}$$
$$= \frac{nl(BA)}{I}$$

$$\mbox{B-Field of a Solenoid} \Rightarrow B = N_oI_n$$
$$L = \frac{nl(N_oI_nA)}{I}$$
$$L = N_on^2Al$$
```ad-important
This means that the inductance is idependent of the current or votlage
