# Generators and Motors

## Generators

- Makes Electricity
- Turns work into Electricity
- Moving metal wires in a B-Field makes a Voltage ($e_{inf}$)
- Turn coil in a B-field. Induces and $e_{inf}$. This makes a current.

**Energy Sources?**
- Wind, water, steam (coal, gas, nuclear, etc.)

## Motors

- Do Work
- Electricity turns into work
- Electricity can make a $B_1$-Field repelled by an external $B_2$-Field
- use an electro-magnet that spins when placed in an external B-Field

# Inductors ($L$)

- Small Solenoid
- Measured in Henrys
- Stores B-Field Energy in Circuit
- Mostly used in AC Circuits
