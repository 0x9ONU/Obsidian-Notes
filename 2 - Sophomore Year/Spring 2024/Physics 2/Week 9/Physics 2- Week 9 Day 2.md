# Solenoids

**Sketch**

![[Physics 2- Week 9 Day 2 2024-03-27 11.05.09.excalidraw]]

```ad-warning
There is no magnetic field on the OUTSIDE
```
## Derivation - $B^\to$ of a Solenoid $\star$

![[Physics 2- Week 9 Day 2 2024-03-27 11.07.13.excalidraw]]

$$N \mbox{ Turns}, L - \mbox{Length}$$

$$\oint B^\to \cdot d l^\to = \mu_o I_{enc}$$
$$\int B^\to \cdot dl_1^\to + \int B^\to \cdot dl_2^\to + \int B^\to \cdot dl_3^\to + \int B^\to \cdot dl_4^\to =\mu_oNI$$
$$B^\to \parallel l^\to_1, B^\to \perp l^\to_2, B^\to =0, B^\to \perp l^\to_4$$
$$\int_o^L Bdl_1 + 0+0 +0 = \mu_o NI$$
$$BL - \mu_oNI$$
$$B = \frac{\mu_o NI}{L}$$
$$B = \mu_o nI \Rightarrow n = \frac{N}{L}$$

### Example - Using Some Numbers with a Long Solenoid

```ad-note
Given:
- $n = 5 * 10^4 \frac{turns}{m}$
- $I = 65A$

```ad-question
What is the magnetic Field?
```

$$B = \mu_o nI$$
$$B = (4 \pi*10^{-7})(5*10^4)(65)$$
$$B= 4.08 T$$

# Gauss' Law for Magnetism

## Review - Gauss' Law for Electric Fields

$$\oint E^\to \cdot dr^\to = \frac{Q_{enc}}{\epsilon_o}$$
```ad-note
Gauss goes over a surface, while Ampere's only goes over a line.
```

This equation can show if there is a source of electric field or a sink. (Positive or Negative).
- With no charges, there is no electric field

Electric field begins and ends at the charges.

## Gauss' Law for Magnetic Fields

- The Field Lines of the Magnetic Field **flow through** the poles

![[Physics 2- Week 9 Day 2 2024-03-27 11.24.14.excalidraw]]

Close Surface, will have both North and South, so there is no magnetic flux $\Phi_B-0$

$$\therefore \oint B^\to da^\to =0$$

```ad-important
That means there are no monopoles for magnets.
```

# Magnetic Fields in Matter

**Atoms**- Classical/Bores Model

![[Physics 2- Week 9 Day 2 2024-03-27 11.30.46.excalidraw]]

- Electron Goes around positive charge
- Moving Charges
- A magnetic field for the atom exists as there is moving charges

**Electron**

![[Physics 2- Week 9 Day 2 2024-03-27 11.33.35.excalidraw]]

- $e^-$ has an associated spin
- Magnetic Field for Electrons

**Magnetic Domains**

*Paper Clips*

![[Physics 2- Week 9 Day 2 2024-03-27 11.35.46.excalidraw]]

- Not Aligned
- $B_T = 0$

*Paper Clip Near Magnet*

![[Physics 2- Week 9 Day 2 2024-03-27 11.37.01.excalidraw]]

- Domains Align
- Get Magnetic Field 

# Making a Magnet

- Align Domains

1. Heat (Typically Iron/Nickel)
2. Put Materials in a Large Magnet Field to Align the Fields
3. Cool Down

# Destroying a Magnet

1. Dropping it 
2. Heat it up

# Terms

1. **Ferro-Magnetism**
   - Strong Magnetic Effects to Magnet Field
   - ex. Iron, Nickel, Cobalt
   - Strongly Attracted to Magnets
2. **Paramagnetic**
   - Weak Magnetic Effects to a Magnetic Field
   - ex. Tungsten, Cesium
   - Weakly Attracted
3. **Diamagnetic**
   - Weak field generated in material - opposes other b-field
   - ex. bismuth, water,
   - Repels
