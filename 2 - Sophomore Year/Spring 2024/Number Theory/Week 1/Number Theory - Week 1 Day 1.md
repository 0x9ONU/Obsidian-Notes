# Class Overview

```ad-note
Euclidean Algebra and Modular Arithmetic from Discrete Math
```

```ad-important
Mainly focuses on the number theory with **APPLICATIONS** of cryptography

```
## Modular Arithmetic
- RSA
- Diffie-Hellman
- DES
	- NOT secure anymore
	- Important to study regardless due to the principles that it used
## Finite Fields
- Advanced Encryption Standard (AES)

## Factoring
- Important in RSA, DH, and Digital Signatures
- For LARGE numbers, which is a difficult math problem

## Discrete Logarithm
- Standard Log
  - $b^x = y$
  -  $x = \log_b y$

```ad-warning
This problem is difficult when $b$ is a large base
```

Given $y$ and given $b$, find $x$ when $b$ is a discretely large base
- Creates groups, which has its own discrete law to solve for the problem
	- ex. $\mathbb{z}p$ OR elliptic curves

Number Systems outside of Real Numbers
