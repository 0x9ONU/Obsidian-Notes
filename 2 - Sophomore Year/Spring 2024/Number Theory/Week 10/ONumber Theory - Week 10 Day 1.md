# Computational Complexity

## Big-O

```ad-summary
title: Definition
$g(n)$ is a funciton that is an asymptotic upper bound for $f(n)$ if there exists numbers $C$ and $n_o$ such that:
$$|f(n)| \le C|g(n)|, \forall n \ge n_o$$
```

The size of $f(n)$ is eventually smaller than the size of $g(n)$.

If $g(n)$ is an asymptotic upper bound for $f(n)$, we also say that $f(n)$ is **Big-O** of $g(n)$

$$f(n) = O(g(n)) \rightarrow f(n) <<g(n)$$
## Big-Omega

```ad-summary
title: Defintion
If there exist numbers $C$ and $n_o$ such that:
$$|f(n)| \ge C g(n), \forall n \ge n_o$$
```

Then, we say that $f$ is big $\Omega$ of g and write 
$$f(n) = \Omega(g(n)) \rightarrow f(n) >> g(n)$$
## Big-Theta

If $f$ is both big-O and big-$\Omega$ of $g$, then we say that $f$ is big-$\Theta$ of $g$ and write: 
$$f(n) = \Theta(g(n))\rightarrow f(n) >><<g(n)$$


## Example

$$f(n) = n^3 +81 \space \& \space g(n) = n^3$$
$$f(n) \ge (1)g(n), \forall n \ge 1$$
$$f(n) \le 2g(n), \forall n \ge 5$$
$$\therefore f=\Theta(n)$$

## Limits Regarding Big O

```ad-important
If the $\lim_{n \to \infty} \frac{f(n)}{g(n)}$ exists (aka is finite), then $f = O(g)$
```

### Informal Proof

$$\frac{f(n)}{g(n)} \rightarrow L \mbox{ as } n \rightarrow \infty$$
Then, eventually:
$$|\frac{f(n)}{g(n)} - L | \rightarrow 0 \mbox{ as } n \rightarrow \infty$$
$$|\frac{f(n)}{g(n)}-L| < 1, \space \forall n \ge n_o$$
$$-1 < | \frac{f(n)}{g(n)} - L |< 1, \space \forall n \ge n_o$$
$$-1 + L < \frac{f(n)}{g(n)} < 1 + L, \space \forall n \ge n_o$$
$$f(n) < (1+L)(g(n)$$
### Example 1

$$f(n) = -2n^3 + 3n^2 + 77 \Rightarrow g(n) = n^3$$
$$\lim_{n \rightarrow \infty}\frac{f(n)}{g(n)}$$
$$\lim_{n \rightarrow \infty} = \frac{-2n^3}{n^3} + \frac{3n^2}{n^3} + \frac{77}{n^3}$$
$$\lim_{n\rightarrow \infty} = -2+ \frac{3}{n}+ \frac{77}{n^3}$$
```ad-note
Both the $n^{-1}$ and $n^{-3}$ terms go to zero as $n$ approaches infinity
```

$$\lim_{n \rightarrow \infty} \frac{f(n)}{g(n)} =-2 $$
### Example 2

$$x^3 = O(2^x)$$
$$\lim_{x \rightarrow \infty} \frac{f(x)}{g(x)} = \frac{(x^3)}{(2^x)}$$
```ad-important
Take L'Hop. Rule
```

$$= \frac{3x^2}{2^x \ln2}$$
$$= \frac{6x}{2^x(\ln2)^2}$$
$$= \frac{6}{2^x(\ln2)^3} = \frac{6}{\infty}$$
$$\therefore \lim_{x\rightarrow \infty} \frac{f(n)}{g(n)} = 0$$
# Discrete Logarithm Problem

```ad-summary
title: Definition
Suppose that $G$ is a gorup adn $g \in G$ has finite order $m$ with multiplicative notation of $\cdot$. For each $h \in <g>$, the itnegers $x$ satisfying the equation $g^x=h$ form a residue calss $\mod m$, aka they have the same modulo of the order of the group $m$.
$$\space$$
The Discrete Logarithm Problem is used to solve for $x$ for any given two elements, $g, h$ of $G$ from the equation:
$$g^x = h$$
```

```ad-note
For addition notation, $g^x=l$ needs to be repalced with $xg=l$
```

$x$ is the discrete logarithm of $h$ to the base $g$ and is denoted by: 

$$x=\log_g(h)$$

```ad-example
- $2^4 \equiv 1 \mod 5$ means that $4$ is the logarithm of $1$ base $2$ in $\mathbb{Z}^\star_5$.
- $3^{24} \equiv 37 \mod 101$, we say that $24$ is the logarihm of $37$ base $3$ int he multiplicative gorup $\mathbb{Z}^\star_{101}$
- Since $46*3 \equiv 37 \mod 101$, we say that $46$ is the logarithm of $37$ base $3$ in the **addative group** $\mathbb{Z}_{101}$
```

## Solving for DLP in Integer Groups

Let $G = \mathbb{Z}/m\mathbb{Z}$, with $m=100, g=1, \mbox{ and } h = 17$, then solving for DLP is very easy.

$$\log_gh = \log_{1}17 = 17 \mbox{ since } 17*1 = 17 \in G = \mathbb{Z}/100\mathbb{Z}$$

## Solving for DLP in Harder Groups

For harder equations, we let the generator $g$ be something other than $G = \mathbb{Z}/m \mathbb{Z}$. Then, find $\log_g h$ is to solve the congruence:
$$xg \equiv h \mod m$$
By using the EEA, we are able to solve for $x$ easily.

### Example

```ad-question
Consider $G_1 = \mathbb{Z}/100\mathbb{Z}$ and $G_2 = (\mathbb{Z}/100/mathbb{Z})^\star$. Both of these are cyclic groups of order 100. BOth are generated by 3. Both contain 17. We now observe that there are two versions of $\log_3 17$ for each $G_1$ and $G_2$. Solve for both:
```

#### For $G_1$

To find the $\log_3 17$ in $G_1$, we need to solve $3n \equiv 17 \mod 100$'

#### For $G_2$

to find $\log_3 17$ in $G_2$, we need to solve $3^x \equiv 17 \mod 101$

## Fermat's Little Theorem and Prime Modulus

In $\mathbb{Z}_p^\star$, if $x$ is a solution to $g^x = h$, then $g^x \equiv h \mod p.$

By Fermat's Little Theorem, $g^{p-1} \equiv 1 \mod p$, so it follows that:

$$g^{x+k(p-1)}=g^x(g^{p-1})^k \equiv h \mod p, \space k \in \mathbb{Z}$$

Thus, if $x$ is a solution to $g^x = h$, then $x+k(p-1)$ is also a solution for any value of $k$.

```ad-important
$\log_g(h)$ is defined only up to adding or subtracting multiples of $p-1$, so $\log_g(h)$ is really defined modulo $p-1$
```

Therefore, we can show that $a, b \in \mathbb{Z}_p^\star$,

$$\log_g(ab) = \log_g(a)+\log_g(b)$$
## Solving by  Trial and Error

Suppose that $G$ is a group and $g \in G$ has finite order $m$. For each $h \in <g>$, the complexity of finding $\log_g h$ or solving $g^x=h$ using trial and error is $\mathbb{O}(m)$. This is the upper bound stands as a lower bound as well for most target elements $h$.

## Breaking Down the Modulo

The group of order $\mathbb{Z}/101\mathbb{Z}$ is $100 =2^2*5^2$. Therefore, we can reduce the problem $3^x \equiv 17 \mod 101$ down into smaller problems.

First find $\log_3 17$ in modulo 2, 4, 5, and 25.
