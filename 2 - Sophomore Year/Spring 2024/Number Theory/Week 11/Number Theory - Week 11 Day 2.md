# HW 3 Review - Groups

## Problem 1 & 2

```ad-question
Is $\mathbb{Z}_10$ a group under multiplication $\mod 10$? If not, does it have a subset that is a gorup under multiplication $\mod 10$?
```

Inverse of $0$ does not exist with respect to multiplication $\mod 10$

$\mathbb{Z}_p$ is **NOT** a group under multiplication

$\mathbb{Z}_{10}^\star = \{1, 3, 7, 9\}$

## Problem 4

```ad-question
Is $\mathbb{R}^n$ is a group under multiplicaiton component wise addation?
```
$$\mathbb{R}^n = \{a_1,...,a_n\}: a_i \in \mathbb{R}, i=1,2,...,n\}$$
$$(a_1, a_2,...,a_n)+(b_1,b_2,..,b_n) = (a_1+b_1,a_2+b_2,...,a_n+b_n)$$

**Associative?**

Since $+$ in each component is associative, it follows that the whole group is associative.

**Identity?**

$$R+(0,0,...,0) = R$$
**Inverse?**

Inverse of $(a_1, a_2,...,a_n)$ is $(-a_1, -a_2,...,-a^n)$

## Problem 6

```ad-question
Let $G$ be a gorup and $x, y \in G$. Call $y$ the conjugate of $x$ denoted by $x \sim y$ if there exists $a \in G$ such that $y=axa^{-1}$. Prove that $\sim$ is an equivalence relation.
