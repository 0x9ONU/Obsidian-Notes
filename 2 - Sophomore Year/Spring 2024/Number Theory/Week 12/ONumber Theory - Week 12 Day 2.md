# Definitions of Security

```ad-note
In the 1970s, this is where cryptographers started to use scientific development for cyptography. They also became aware of possible attacks that could be used against a specific cipher
```

**Modern Cryptography as the following**:

1. Formal definitions
2. Assumptions
3. Proofs

```ad-example
Examples of assumptions:
- A computer can take a long time to factor a number as long as the prime numbers within it are large.
```

## Kerkoff's Principle

```ad-summary
The secruity of a cryptosystem should depend only on **the secrecy of the key** and not on the secrecy of the encryption or decryption function itself.
```

```ad-example
Before the 1970s, because the government mainly used it, they kept the encryption and decryption algorithms secret and made it illegal for people to publish them. However, they relied to heavily on the secrecy of the algorithm. Once people started cracking them and started spreading around secretly, they realized that their cyptographic system was no longer secure.
```

## Perfect Secrecy/Indistinguishability

```ad-summary
title: Definition
An encryption scheme is perfectly secret if for all plaintexts $m_0, m_1 \in \mathcal{M}$ and all cipher texts $c \in \mathcal{C}$:

$$Pr[\mathcal{E}_k(m_0)=c] = Pr(\mathcal{E}_k(m_1) = c]$$
$$\space$$
Where the probabilies are computed over randomly generated keys $k \in \mathcal{K}$
```

Perfect secrecy means that all plaintexts have the same probability for a given ciphertext. Without the secret key, it is impossible to find out which plaintext was encrypted. This property is also known as perfect indistinguishability:  An eavesdropper truly learns nothing about the plaintext from the cipher text, provided that any key is possible. In other words, given a ciphertext $c$, every plaintext $m$ is exactly as likely to be the underlying plaintext.

```ad-note
The definition requires a fixed plaintext length since encyption usually doesn't hide the length of a plaintext.
```

```ad-important
This provides security only against "cipher text only attack"
- Where someone can *only* find the cipher text and has to reverse engineer it to find the plaintext.
```

```ad-example
The one-time pad is a perfectly secret if the key is generated by a random number generator and is only used once.
```
### Alternate Definition

```ad-summary
title: Defintion
An encyption scheme is perfectly secret if and only if for every distribution over $\mathcal{M}$, every plaintext $m$, and every ciphertext $c$ for which $Pr[c] > 0$, the probability of $m$ and the conditonal probability of $m$ given $c$ are equal. That is:

$$Pr[m|c] = Pr[m]$$
```

```ad-note
Keep in mind: We assume a uniform distribution of keys. Regardless of which key generator algorithm you have, it gives you a key using a random number generator. Every key is *equally likely* to be given to the user.
```

### Exercise 1 - One-Time Pad

```ad-question
Prove that the one-time pad is perfeclty secret if the key is genrated by a random bit generator and is only used once.
```

Given $m_1, m_2, c$

$$Pr[\mathcal{E}_k(m_1)=c]$$
```ad-note
$$m = e = k = \{ 0, 1 \}^n$$
```

$$\mathcal{E}_k(m) = c$$
$$k \oplus m = c$$
$$m = c \oplus k$$

```ad-important
This means that only one key would work
```

$$Pr[\mathcal{E}_k(m_1)=c] = \frac{\mbox{\# of keys that work}}{\mbox{Total \# of keys}}$$
$$Pr[\mathcal{E}_k(m_1)=c] = \frac{1}{2^n}$$

**Check for a different plaintext**

$$Pr(\mathcal{E}_k(m_2) = c] = \frac{1}{2^n}$$

$$\therefore Pr[\mathcal{E}_k(m_1)=c] = Pr[\mathcal{E}_k(m_2)=c]$$

**It is perfectly secret**

### Exercise 2 - Vigen√®re Cipher

```ad-question
title: Problem Statement
Suppose a Vigenere CIpher of key length 3 is used to encrypt a plaintext with four characters. Let $c = (y_1, y_2, y_3, y_4)$ be any cipher text of length 4, and $m = (x_1, x_2, x_3, x_4)$ the corresponding plaintext and $\bar{k} = (k_1, k_2, k_3)$ the key.
```

$$y_1 \equiv x_1 + k_1, y_2 \equiv x_2 + k_2, y_3 \equiv x_3 + k_3, y_4 \equiv x_4 + k_1 \mod 26$$

**Solving for the First and Last Equation**

$$k_1 \equiv y_1 - x_1 \mod 26$$
$$k_1 \equiv y_4 - x_4 \mod 26$$
$$y_1 -x_1 \equiv y_4-x_4 \mod 26 \space \space \space \star $$

```ad-important
Equaiton $\star$ puts a condition on valid plaintext-ciphertext pairs. This makes it so that we can choose many unfeasible plaintexts $m_o$. So, $\mathcal{E}_k(m_0) \ne c$ for all $k \in \mathcal{K}$.

$$\therefore Pr[\mathcal{E}_k(m_o) = c] = 0$$
```

```ad-note
This divides the message space into two areas where star is valid and where star is NOT valid.
$$\mathcal{M} = \begin{bmatrix} m_o : \star \mbox{ not valid} \\ m_1 : \star \mbox{ valid} \end{bmatrix}$$
```

$$Pr[\mathcal{E}_k(m_1) = c] = \frac{\mbox{\# key satisfying theorem}}{\mbox{total \# keys}}$$

$$= \frac{1}{36^3}$$

$$\therefore Pr[\mathcal{E}_k(m_0)=c] \ne Pr[\mathcal{E}_k(m_1)=c]$$
**It is NOT perfectly secret**
