# Discrete Probablity

```ad-summary
title: Definition
A discrete probability space conssists of two pieces:
- A countable (fiinite for this course) set $\Omega$ called the sample space which consists of all possible outcomes of an experiment
- A probability funciton (a method of assigning a probability to each possible outcome).
```

$$Pr: \Omega \rightarrow \mathbb{R}$$

Interpret $Pr(\omega)$ = "Probability that event $\omega$ occurred."

$$0 \le Pr(\omega) \le 1$$

```ad-note
Random experiment:
- A process that can lead to multiple different outcomes
