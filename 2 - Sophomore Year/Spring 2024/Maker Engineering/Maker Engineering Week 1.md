## Highlights

- One guided project. (Individual) 
- One semester long project. (team project)
	- Done in 6 steps
- Finish all assignments and submit them on time.

## Course Topics

- Design a printed circuit board (PCB)
- Integrate a PCB into a mechanical design.
- Assemble a PCB suing surfac emount technology and using thorugh-hole soldering.
- Fabricate and testing a PCB
- Interface a microcontroller such as Arduino with a custom PCB.
- Extract relevant information form a datasheet and then use it for the design.
- Develop an engineering solution that creates value.

## First Task

The first task is to identify possible needs.
- Brainstorm individually then present those to your team.
- As a team, select one of the proposed needs before next week.

# Need Proposals

How to identify needs:
- Use internet
- Look at previous years projects
- Ask people. Find a real client

Make sure the need is:
- Interesting to the team
- Is feasible given the time frame, your team members' skill-sets, and budget ($100)
- Creates values.
- Must lead to a physical prototype
- Incorporate a PCB and microcontroller in the final prototype

# Guided Project

A Double LED Blinker controlled by an arduino.

## Steps

1. Create Circuit Schematic (Week 1)
2. Create PCB Layout (Week 2)
3. Create Enclosure Assembly for the PCB. (Week 3)
4. PCB Fabrication and Enclosure 3D printing. (Week 4)
5. PCB soldering and testing. (Week 7)
6. Full assembly (Week 10)
