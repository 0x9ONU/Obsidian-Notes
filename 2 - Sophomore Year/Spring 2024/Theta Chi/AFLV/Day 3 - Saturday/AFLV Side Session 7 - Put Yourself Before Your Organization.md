# Balance

**Lead by Example**
- Change chapter culture
- Do not stay up as late for your chapter operations.

**It's not that deep**
- Thank you for letting me know
- Do not let small things affect you
- "X did not show up to an event" 
	- Who cares???

**Delegate Tasks**
- phone a brother/friend
- Even if they do it slightly wrong, it is better than doing it alone.
- Pull leaders from the community. You are not limited to Greek Life

**Its okay to say *NO***
- Start small, your calendar will thank you
- Do not be the "yes" person
- Do not accept an offer at the last second
- Do *not* feel guilty to say no. It will become easier overtime

## Balance and Boundaries are **NOT** the same

**Hard Boundaries**
- Not flexible
- They are the oak trees of boundaries
- Sturdy and tough

```ad-important
These boundaries should never move regardless of what people say
```

```ad-example
- Do not answer emails after 6pm. It can make you carried away with what you are doing.
```

**Soft Boundaries**
- Flexible, they can bend when necessary.
- Willow trees of boundaries
- Flexible and flowing

```ad-example
- Prefer not to answer text or calls after 6pm, but if it is important, take the call or respond.
```

## Looking Forward

**Review Your Boundaries**
- These can change, make them what *you need*

**Utilize the 4 tools for balancing**
- These are tools for you to really learn to balance leadership with life.

**Take it back to your chapter/councils**
- Share it with your chapter members. Make sure they know your life balance and boundaries.

```ad-important
Remember to take care of yourself.
- Do not pushaway other parts of your life to try and focus on one part of your life
```
