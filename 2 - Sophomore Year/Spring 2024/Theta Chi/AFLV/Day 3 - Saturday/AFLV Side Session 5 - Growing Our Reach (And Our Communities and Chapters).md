# Introduction

Heather Matthews
- Did not think about joining a Sorority
	- Everyone was already in as Rush happened before getting on campus
	- Had parentals that were not in Greek life
- Had a struggling chapter
	- 200+ members on other chapters VS. 50 for their chapter
- Want to spread the importance of recruitment
- Worked with Nationals for 10 years

About changing lives, not about the money

# Growth Mindset

## Setting Goals

- **What's your why?**
	- Thriving chapters
	- Changing lives
- **Barriers to growth?**
	- Overcoming objections
- **What to consider:**
	- How many showed interest last year?
	- How about 2019?
	- What does it take for our chapter to feel healthy and thriving?

```ad-warning
75% of chapters do NOT have a goal. Most of the 25% just want to do the same as last semester.
```

## What We Mean by Recruitment

1. **Primary Push**: Primary recruitment, rush, intake, etc.
	1. Where you get most of your members
2. **Continuous Recruitment:** Informal, Continuous Open Bidding
3. **As a Lifestyle**
	1. You have to keep cultivating a story year round to help give bids during primary/open

## Who are we reaching?

- **Always Joiners**
	- Those who come in WANTING to join Greek Life.
	- Often the main focus of recruitment
- First-Generation College Students
	- 16-17% of students on campuses are first-gen students
		- 33% are on clubs/councils across campus
	- These people do not know the lingo
		- Rush, bids, etc.
	- They do not understand what we offer
	- They know only the bad stereotypes and keeps them away
- Students of Color
- Other populations
	- Commuters
	- Upperclassman
	- Queer Community
	- International Students
	- Honors Students
	- Leadership Councils
