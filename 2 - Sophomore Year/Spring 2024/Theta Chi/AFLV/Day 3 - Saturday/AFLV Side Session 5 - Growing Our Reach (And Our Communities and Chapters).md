Session 236

# Introduction

Heather Matthews
- Did not think about joining a Sorority
	- Everyone was already in as Rush happened before getting on campus
	- Had parentals that were not in Greek life
- Had a struggling chapter
	- 200+ members on other chapters VS. 50 for their chapter
- Want to spread the importance of recruitment
- Worked with Nationals for 10 years

```ad-important
About changing lives, not about the money
```

# Growth Mindset

## Setting Goals

- **What's your why?**
	- Thriving chapters
	- Changing lives
- **Barriers to growth?**
	- Overcoming objections
- **What to consider:**
	- How many showed interest last year?
	- How about 2019?
	- What does it take for our chapter to feel healthy and thriving?

```ad-warning
75% of chapters do NOT have a goal. Most of the 25% just want to do the same as last semester.
```
