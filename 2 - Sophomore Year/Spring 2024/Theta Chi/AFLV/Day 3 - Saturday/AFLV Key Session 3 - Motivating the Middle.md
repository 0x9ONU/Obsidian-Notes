# Engagement

```ad-summary
At every group of people there are:
- People who are super engaged (top third members)
	- Run for office
	- Do something everyday
	- Always have a report and are at front
- Regular members (middle third)
	- Really nice people, but they don't go for office *without* convincing.
	- The fraternity is important, but they have to give time to everything else on campus.
	- Might drop less time into fraternity in order to keep the other balls up
- Bottom Third
	- People who do not care anymore like seniors
	- People who "drop off the Earth"
	- Seniors do not feel connected to the chapter anymore

```ad-warning
These people CANNOT be moved forcably moved around.
- "Lead, motivate, influence and impact them from where they are, not where you wish they would be."
```

```ad-important
You must lead all of these people at every level of engagement **separately**.
```

## Top Third

- **POSITIVE** - Identity, validation, success
	- Tries to get as many awards as possible
- **NEGATIVE** - Empathy, Always Busy,
	- When the chapter does not get things done, it feels bad.
	- Cannot stand delegations who do not do what they need to do and could get burned out from it
	- Does not have time for giving time to other things or themselves
	- Put more on the pile than take anything off

## Bottom Third

- **Positive** - Criticize, Fun, Respect
	- Will give you good criticism on bad decision 
	- Keeps the ego in check
	- Very fun when at social gatherings
- **Negative** - Rules, You
	- Does not respect authority and does what they want
	- Will not respect the Presidents. **They don't hate you, they hate the authority you have over them**
- **How to Spot** - Drama, MIA
	- Always tries to dodge events with as many excuses as possible
	- Stirs up as much controversy as possible.

```ad-warning
Do not waste your time trying to convert them into the top third
```

## Middle Third

- **Positive** - Balance, Relationships
	- Will help you do things, but will not *always* be there for everything
	- Is there for the brotherhood and wants to hangout with them
- **Negative** - Negativity, Disorganization
	- Do not like being in the middle of the fight between the top and bottom thirds
		- "Its the same people doing all the work blah blah blah"
		- Top third agrees
		- Bottom third heckles at them
		- Middle third does not understand why everyone is mad
	- HATE when someone gets information wrong during a report and make things convoluted. 
	- Needs time off from things and an easy-to-digest schedule
	- HATES mandatory events.
- **How to Spot** - In the background
	- Supporting in the background
	- Friends that are not officiers
	- Shows up when top thirds are stressed and help them out
	- Keeps top-third from falling apart

```ad-important
**The Biggest Mistakes**
- Do not get burned out coming out of this conference with a bucket full. Reality will suck but work up from the bottom.
- Gets pissed at the chapter and make things mandatory. DONT DO IT.
- You cannot change people
```

# Motivations

## Top Third

- Say thank you to them.
- Let them know that they are important

## Bottom Third

- Let them live their lives.
- Get off their asses.
- Give them what they want.
- Do not focus on them

```ad-important
Come up with a list to create the "good-enough" brother. This is the bare-minimum list, which is where if they do not do it, they should be voted out. Include stuff like:
- Come to chapter part of the time
- One mandatory events
```

## Middle Third

```ad-important
FOCUS ON THE MIDDLE THIRD RATHER THAN THE BOTTOM THIRD.
```

- Make it more social
- Make it more positive
- **Tasks** not positions
- Reduce MANDATORY
- Always have **end times.**
	- STOP at the 60-90 minute mark regardless of how much time is needed.
	- Long chapters KILL engagement
- Get rid of reports at meetings
- Demand officers communicate better
	- Say the information right the first time!

# We Are All Bottom Third

- In one organization/group, we do not give nearly as much time into it.
	- Some random club, PTO, etc.
- Do not judge others who are bottom third in the organization *you* lead
