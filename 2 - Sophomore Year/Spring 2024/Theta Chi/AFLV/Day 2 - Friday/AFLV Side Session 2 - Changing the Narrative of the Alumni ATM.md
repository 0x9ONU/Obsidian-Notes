```ad-important
Financial should be the final step. Work up to this thorugh relationships first.
```

## 3 "T's" of Support:

1. Time - They can give time
2. Talent - They have a specific skill to give (BOD, CAB, etc.)
3. **Treasure**

## Transactional Relationships

Relationships that are built solely on the expectation of reciprocation and personal gain that are instantaneous and do not require follow-up or follow-through.
- Not fulfilling
- Needs to be avoided

# Scenarios

## Scenario #1:

Alpha Chapter has upcoming house renovations that are needed and began a fundraising campaign for $100,000 solely solicited towards chapter alumni. The chapter currently does not have a volunteer/alumni board. While soliciting volunteer interest, the organization begins to learn that the chapter does not engage or communicate with their alumni-base nor do they engage in conversations with the alumni that show up to events. this has been the standard for over ten years.

| ------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------- | -------- |
| The chapter needs financial assistance and only sees their alumni base as an ATM. They do not communicate effectively with their alumni, do not have engaged volunteers, and do not see the short or long-term benefits of engaging alumni/volunteers in a non-financial manner | - Lack of mentors and professional opportunities<br>- Lack of a sounding board; chapter is stuck in the details rater than the big picture<br>- Lack of consistency; chapter restarts with every term <br>- Lack of local alumni/volunteers.         |
## Scenario 2

Omega Chapter recently celebrated their centennial anniversary at University Y. They have an involved group of alumni/volunteers who serve on their advisory board and have been in their roles for years. The board has a presence at every chapter meeting, event, and activity. The board has a voice in very aspect of chapter operations., Young-alumni involvement in the chapter or advisory board is practically non-existent.
