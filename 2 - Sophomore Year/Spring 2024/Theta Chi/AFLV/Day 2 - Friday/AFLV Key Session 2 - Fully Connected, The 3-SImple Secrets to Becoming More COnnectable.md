# Loneliness

```ad-important
Loneliness is a abscence of connection, *not* people
- Someone who is surrounded by people will often still feel lonely.
- We need more than a mere presence.
```

## Connection Points

- Oneself
- Greek Members
- Campus Community
- Family
- Work Relationships
- Significant Other

Loneliness is the perceived inadequacy of connection, based on desired levels. When someone feels like their connection quota is not being met, they'll begin to feel lonely.

## Exclusion in the Brain

People who were put through an experience of exclusion. Their brain lit up. It was the same part of the brain that registers pain.
- Was caused due to evolution as loneliness was a death sentence
- We need each other to build shelter, raise families, feed ourselves, etc.

```ad-warning
Being lonely for 15 years is like smoking 15 cigarettes a day over that time.
```
## Loneliness & Mental Health
Can lead to:
- Depression
- Anxiety
- Psychosis
- Substance Use
- Suicide

## State of Disconnection Worldwide

- 72% of global workers *feel lonely at least monthly*, with 52% feel
- 49% of Americans have 3 or fewer close friends
- 33% of Americans have no close friends at all
- 79% of Gen Z say that they sometimes or always feeling lonely.

```ad-important
It has lead to a nation-wide state of emergency over social isolation and loneliness
```

## What is Causing the Social Disconnection?

1. **Social Snacking** - That most of our touch points in connections are not face-to-face in-person. Provides hits of dopamine, but is not healthy. Long amounts in digital environments can lead to loneliness.
2. **Dependency Shift** - Went from connecting and calling people when they have a problem to just "Googling it".
3. **Lack of Purpose** - Connections happen from doing things that are meaningful to you.
4. **Increased Busyness** - Less time for connections leads to worse connections.
5. **Focus On Fitting In** - Puts up a mask/avatar to fit into a group.

# Strategies

## Strategy #1: Connect Like Oprah

```ad-important
Communication ***IS NOT*** Connection
```

- Tactical **communication**, while important, does not establish connection.
- Information is processed in the front of the brain

**Prosocial Behaviors** 
- Acts of comforting, sharing, helping or cooperating, backed by general concern for feeling, welfare, and rights of other people.
- People who are on the receiving end of this is 278% more likely to do it themselves.

### The Seven Things Oprah Does

1. No Physical Barriers (*She Can Get Physically Close*)
2. Deep Eye Contact (*Looks Right At You*)
3. Leverages Personal Knowledge (*Says Kids Names*)
4. Leans In (*Non-verbal Cue She Is Interested*)
5. Subtly Repeats Back (*"I Withhold My Power"*)
6. Abundant Touch (*Hand ON Shoulder*)
7. Full Focus (*Provides Undivided Attention*)

## Strategy #2: Be More Interruptible

### Social Experiment

Were asked to give a speech across campus and along the way they would encounter a person who was in need. They were told that they were either & x percentage helped:
- "Plenty of Time" to get over 63%
- "On-Time" 45%
- "Late" 10%

### Becoming More Interruptible

- Build a social regimen
	- When creating a schedule, find time where you can connect with people.
- Establish Phone Free Zones
	- ex. when you are in line, try not to use your phone
- Be Mindful Of Connection Cues
	- Looking at a device, having headphones in, or being face down in work makes it seem like you are not interested in conversation

## Strategy #3: Build Significance

```ad-important
Be an illluminator. Shine a psecial spotlight on the people around you.
```

1. Display Gratitude
2. Listen "Loud"
3. They ask thoughtful questions.
	1. AVOID: How are you? How was your weekend? 
	2. Make more personal questions: Where are you from? How long have you lived here? 
4. Validate their worth. (The best way to get someone out of a slump is to use *I need you* statements)
