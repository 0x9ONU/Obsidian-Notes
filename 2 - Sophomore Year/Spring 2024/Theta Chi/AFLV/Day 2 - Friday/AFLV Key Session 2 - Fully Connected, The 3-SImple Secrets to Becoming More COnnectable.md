# Loneliness

```ad-important
Loneliness is a abscence of connection, *not* people
- Someone who is surrounded by people will often still feel lonely.
- We need more than a mere presence.
```

## Connection Points

- Oneself
- Greek Members
- Campus Community
- Family
- Work Relationships
- Significant Other

Loneliness is the perceived inadequacy of connection, based on desired levels. When someone feels like their connection quota is not being met, they'll begin to feel lonely.

## Exclusion in the Brain

People who were put through an experience of exclusion. Their brain lit up. It was the same part of the brain that registers pain.
- Was caused due to evolution as loneliness was a death sentence
- We need each other to build shelter, raise families, feed ourselves, etc.

```ad-warning
Being lonely for 15 years is like smoking 15 cigarettes a day over that time.
```

## What is Causing the Social Disconnection?

2. **Dependency Shift** - Went from connecting and calling people when they have a problem to just "Googling it".
3. **Lack of Purpose** - Connections happen from doing things that are meaningful to you.
4. **Increased Busyness** - Less time for connections leads to worse connections.
5. **Focus On Fitting In** - Puts up a mask/avatar to fit into a group.
