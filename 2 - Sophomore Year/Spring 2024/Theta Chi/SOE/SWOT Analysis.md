**Opportunities**

1. *Alumni Engagement from CAB/BOD*: The Board of Directors (BOD) and the Chapter Advisor Board (CAB) are two important alumni resources that our chapter should be utilizing more fully in the upcoming year. The BOD is the main group of alumni officers that are entrusted in the chapter's larger finances and assist the organization in topics that may be too difficult for the undergraduate brothers to solve on their own. They consist of brothers new and old and hold elections to select those who are most qualified for the position. The CAB, on the other hand, utilizes newer alumni talent and mirrors some of the main executive branches such as health and safety, recruitment, scholarship, and new member education. The CAB chairman delegates these people as resigns his role to the next alumni willing to carry forth his legacy. Even though both of these alumni congregations are full of talented people, the chapter has struggled to voice its concerns to these committees in the past few years. Therefore, to improve our alumni relations as well as gather input on improving chapter moral, Greek Life engagement, and preparing data from the past, the resources that both the BOD and CAB offer are unprecedented and should be a great opportunity for the chapter moving forward.
   
2. *Eclipse/Founders Day*: Theta Chi as an organization was founded on April 10th, 1856, which we now celebrate with alumni every anniversary. As coincidence, the Great American Solar Eclipse happens to land on the Monday before on April 8th. Many alumni, due to the circumstances, took off work on the 8th to watch the solar eclipse in Ada because the town is in the region of totality. Therefore, the chapter has decided to move many of its major events to be compacted in such a way to maximize the amount of events alumni can attend in that short amount of time.  The opportunity provided by the eclipse weekend to improve alumni and Greek Life engagement is unlike any other the chapter has seen in years. The events and their dates can be seen in Table ***X*** below. 

| Event          | Day                 | Time    |

| Solar Eclipse  | Monday, April 8th   | 2pm     |
3. *Fraternity Bond and Socialization*: Between their school work, their roles in Theta Chi, and their other organization's obligations, brothers have found it difficult to relax and decreased their moral towards events we put on. Therefore, improving the bonds between brothers through greater socialization and having more fun with each other is necessary to improve the overall happiness of the chapter

4. *Big Events in the Spring and Fall*: Spring-boarding off of the most successful philanthropy events in the
