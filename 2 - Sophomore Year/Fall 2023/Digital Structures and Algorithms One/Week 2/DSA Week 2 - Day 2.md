# `Sizeof()` function

Returns the total amount of memory storage (in bytes) needed to store the variable/object passed to it as an input argument
- If the identifier for an array is given as input, will return the overall number of bytes needed to store the array
- Used to determine the number of elements in an array (assuming `arr[]` is initialized above)

The following gets the number of elements within an array:
```c++
int n = sizeof(arr) / sizeof(arr[0])
```

# Pointers

## Pointer Analogy - Index Page in a Book

- Every keyword in the index page is a pointer
- It points at the actual page that has the content
- Stores references where to go get the data/information
- For real pointers, it stores addresses rather than page numbers

## Memory Structure

Memory is an addressable space and every byte has an address
- An array of bytes
- Each memory cell is 1 **byte**
- Addresses at a max of *$2^{64}$ bytes

```ad-note
`0x` means Hexadecimal Representation (ex. `0x2A38`)
```

### How a program is executed?

After successful compilation of a source code, it is loaded into the memory to be executed
- Every program has its own separate space.
- The memory space is divided into several parts

```ad-important
- The **Stack** containes all variables that are created during compile time. 
- The **Heap** contains all variables that were created *dynamically*
```
