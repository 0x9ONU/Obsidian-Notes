# Learning Objectives

- Describe how the insertion sort algorithm processes an array of integers

# Insertion Sort

```ad-note
It is similar to sorting a hand of cards in order, but instead going from one end to the other
```

**Initialization**: Given input sequence: $< a_1, a_2, ..., a_n>$
- Sorted: $<a_1>$
- Unsorted: $<a_2,...,a_n>$
- Inserts next element from the unsorted subsequence into the correct spot of the sorted subsequence, shifting element rightward, as we move leftward
- Increasing size of sorted subsequence while decreasing size of unsorted subsequence by 1.
