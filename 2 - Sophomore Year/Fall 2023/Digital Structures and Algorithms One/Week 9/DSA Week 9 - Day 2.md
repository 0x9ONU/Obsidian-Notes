# Growth Rate Analogy: Counting Bricks in a Structure

If we want to lay some landscaping bricks to edge our flowerbed with mulch, and we need 3 bricks for 1m, how many bricks will we need to line 10m of flowerbed?
- $30 * 3 = 90 \space bricks$ (Linear Growth)

What if our landscaping business also builds brick walls? 
* $30^2 * 3 = 2700 \space bricks$ (Quadratic)
