- Motion of Rigid Object

```

# Motion of Rigid Solid

```ad-note
Rotation is more important than translation
```
## Translational Motion (Point-like Particle)

```ad-summary
Treat the object like we have always been treating it
```

## Rotational Motion 

#comebacklater ex. 1

A rotational axis is chosen at random based on how the object is rotation. There are any number of points that create an arc and rotate around that axis.

### Velocity
#### Linear Physical Quantities

$$v = \frac{\Delta s}{\Delta t} = \frac{arc}{time \space interval}$$


```ad-important
title: Finding $s_i$ and $s_f$
#comebacklater ex. 2
```

```ad-note
$$[v]_{si} = \frac{m}{s}$$
```

```ad-warning
Linear velocity is **DIFFERENT** for each point on the rotating rigid object
```
#### Angular Physical Quantity

$$w = \frac{\Delta \Theta}{\Delta t} = \frac{angle \space swept}{time \space interval}$$

#comebacklater ex. 3

```ad-note
$$[w]_{si} = \frac{rad}{s}$$
```

```ad-important
Each point on a rotating rigid object has **the same** angular velocity
```
### Radians

For an arbitrarily chosen points $M$ and $N$ on a circle:

$$angle_{in \space radians} = \frac{\overset{\huge\frown}{MN}}{R}$$

### Relation between $v$ and $w$

$$v = wR$$
### Acceleration

#### Linear Acceleration

$$a_t = \frac{\Delta v}{\Delta t}$$

```ad-warning
It is only the change in the magnitude of the ciruclar motion because it is a tangential acceleration
```

```ad-note
$$[a]_{si} = \frac{m}{s^2}$$
```

#### Angular Velocity

$$\alpha = \frac{\Delta w}{\Delta t}$$

```ad-note
$$[\alpha]_{si} = \frac{rad}{s^2}$$
```

#### Relationship between $a_t$ and $\alpha$

$$a_t = \alpha R$$

```ad-important
This is because the radius of the point from the axis is always constant
```
