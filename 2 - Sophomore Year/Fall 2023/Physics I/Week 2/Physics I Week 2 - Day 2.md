# Kinematics Introduction Cont.

## Physical Quantity
### (a) Displacement

Denoted as $Δx = x_f-x_i$

```ad-note
The si unit of displacement is meters ($m$)
```

```ad-important
Displacement can be positive, negative, zero
```

### (b) Distance Traveled

The distance the object went over the entire time period.

$$d = $$

```ad-note
Is ALWAYS a positve quantity. Zero ONLY IF the object is not moving.
```

```ad-warning
Will not be used much
```
### (c) Average Velocity

$$ \bar{v} = \frac{\Delta x}{\Delta y} = \frac{x_f-x_i}{t_f-t_i} $$

```ad-note
color: 255, 255, 0
- The SI unit for Average Velocity is $\frac{m}{s}$
- Has the same sign as the displacement ($\Delta x$)
```

### (d) Average Speed

$$ \frac{distance traveled}{\Delta t}$$
```ad-note
color: 180, 100, 180
The SI unit of Average Speed is $\frac{m}{s}$
```

```ad-example
A horse trots away from its trainer in a straight 
line, moving 38 $m$ away in 7.4 $s$. It then turns abruptly and 
gallops halfway back in 1.8 $s$. Calculate (a) its average 
speed and (b) its average velocity for the entire trip, using 
“away from the trainer” as the positive direction.

```ad-check
title: Solution
- (a) Average Speed
	- $Average Speed = \frac{distance traveled}{\Delta t} = \frac{(38m)+(19m)}{9.2s} = 6.19 \frac{m}{s}$
- (b) Average Velocity for the Entire Trip
	- $\bar{v} = \frac{\Delta x}{\Delta y} = \frac{x_f-x_i}{t_f-t_i} = \frac{(19m)-(0m)}{(9.2s)-(0s)} = 2.07 \frac{m}{s}$
```

### (e) Instantaneous Velocity

$$ v = \lim_{\Delta t \to 0} \frac{\Delta x}{\Delta t} = \frac{dx}{dt} $$

```ad-important
The tangent of the triangle created by the secant line, $\Delta x$ and $\Delta t$ is Average Velocity
$$ \bar{v} = \frac{\Delta x}{\Delta t} = \tan{\alpha}$$
```ad-note
The instantaneious velocity ($v_A$) of a point is the slop eof the line tangent to the graph $x(t)$ at the given point 
```

### (f) Average Acceleration

$$ \bar{a} = \frac{\Delta v}{\Delta t} = \frac{v_f-v_i}{t_f-t_i}$$

```ad-note
Measured in $\frac{m}{s^2}$
```
### (g) Instantaneous Acceleration

$$ a = \lim_{\Delta t \to 0} \frac{\Delta v}{\Delta t} = \frac{dv}{dt} = \frac{d^2x}{dt^2}$$

![[CamScanner 08-30-2023 16.13_3.jpg]]

```ad-important
The average acceleration ($\bar{a}) is the tangent of the triangle created by $\Delta v$, $\Delta t$, and the secant line created by connecting $t_i$ and $t_f$
```ad-note
The instantaneous acceleration at a point is the slpe of the line tangent at the point to the graph $v(t) at the given point
```
