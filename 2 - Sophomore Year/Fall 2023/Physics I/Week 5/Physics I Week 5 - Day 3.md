```ad-check 
title: Solution
1. Find the Acceleration of each Block
	- Draw Forces
		- #comebacklater ex.1
	- Sum of all forces for $m_A$
		- $N^{->}+T^{->}+m_{A}g^{->} = m_Aa^{->}$
	- $m_A$ along $x$ axis
		- $(0) + T + (0) = m_{A}a_x$
		- $a_x = a$ There is no acceleration along y!
		- $T = m_{A}a$
	- $m_A$ along $y$ axis
		- $N + 0 + -m_{A}g = m_{A}a_y$
		- $a_y = 0$
		- $N -m_{A}g = 0$
	- Sum of all forces for $m_{B}$
		- $T^{->}+m_{B}g^{->} = m_{B}a^{->}$
	- $m_B$ along direction of motion (THERE IS NO X MOTION)
		- $-T + m_{B}g = m_{B}a$
	- Create a system of equations and add them to cancel Tension and Find acceleration
		- $T = m_{A}a$
		- $-T+m_{B}g = m_{B}a$
		- $m_{B}g=a(m_{A}+m{B})$
		- $a = \frac{m_{B}g}{m_{A}+m_{B}}$
		- $a = \frac{(5)(9.8)}{(5)+(14)}$
		- $a = 2.58 \frac{m}{s^2}$
2. Find Tension in the String
	- $T = m_{A}a$
	- $T = 14 * 2.58 = 36.1 N$
3. How long does it take to move 1.25s?
	- Use kinematic equations
		- $x = x_i + v_it _ \frac{1}{2}at^2
		- $1.25 = 0 + 0 + \frac{1}{2}(2.58)t^2$
		- $t = 1.39s$
```

# More Mechanical Forces

## Kinetic Friction

The force that opposes motion
- Happens when an object is moving on a hard surface.
- It will be in the opposite direction of the motion

#comebacklater ex. 2

```ad-important
The force of kinetic fricition is proportional to the normal force
$$ \space$$
$$F_k \~ N$$
$$ \space $$
$$F_k = M_k N$$
- The mew is a coefficient of k\inetic friction
- It has no unit`
```

## Static Friction

```ad-note
The force of static friction is equivalent to the opposite of the force being acted upon it *as long as* it has **no resultant acceleration**
```

#comebacklater ex. 3

$$0 \le F_s \le F_{smax}$$
```ad-warning
Is variable, but does not have a formula
```

```ad-important
However, the $F_{smax}$ *does* have a formula:
$$\space$$
$$\space$$
$$ F_{smax} = M_sN$$
```

```ad-note
$$M_s > M_k$$
```

## Example with Friction

#comebacklater ex. 4

```ad-check
title: Solution
- Note that $F_{smax} = 35N
1. Find Coefficient fo Static Friction
	- Find Sum of all forces
		- $N^{->} + F_{starting}^{->} + mg^{->} + F^{->}_{smax} = ma^{->}$
	- Along $y$ axis
		- $N + 0 + (-mg) + 0 = 0$
		- $N = mg$
	- Find Coefficient
		- $F_{smax} = M_sN$
		- $35 = M_s (4*9.8)$
		- $M_s = 0.89$
2. Find Kinetic Friction
	- Create New Drawing with Kinetic Friciton
		- #comebacklater ex. 5
	- Find Sum of All forces
		- $N^{->} + F^{->} + F^{->}_k + mg^{->} = ma^{->}$
	- Along $y$ axis
		- $N = mg$
	- Along $x$ axis
		- $F - F_k = ma$ NOTE: $a_x = a$ in this problem
		- $(35) - F_k = (4)(0.6)$
		- $F_k = 35 - 4*0.6
		- $F_k = 32.6N$
	- Calculate coefficient
		- $F_k = M_k*N$
		- $M_k = \frac{F_k}{mg}$
		- $M_k = \frac{32.6}{4*9.8}$
		- $M_k = 0.83$
