# Forces Encountered in Mechanics
## Weight

#comebacklater  ex. 2

The force that is proportional to the gravity pulling against the mass of an object

$$Weight = mg$$
```ad-example
$$m = 0.2kg$$
$$mg =  0.2 * 9.8 = 1.96 (N)$$
```

```ad-note
Even though the magnitude of the force is the same for both the apple and the Earth, only the apple accelerates towards the Earth due to its mass. Earth, having a massive mass, would be unaffected.
```

## Normal 


The reaction of a hard surface which has been pressed by an object
- Happens whenever an object sits on a hard surface.
- Equal to the force of gravity pulling on the object on the hard surface
- **Perpendicular to the hard surface**

$$N = mg$$
```ad-warning
Normal force **DOES NOT** apply to objects dangling in the air
```

#comebacklater ex. 3

```ad-important
The normal force vector will equal the weight vector ONLY when the hard surface is not tilted
```

#comebacklater ex. 4

## Tension in The String

The reaction to an object pulling on a string:
- Pulls away from the object at where the string is attached to the object

#comebacklater ex. 5

```ad-note
In an ideal case where:
- Pully mass is negligable
- The string's mass is negligable
- The string cannot stretch
```ad-important
- The same string will have the same tension on both ends
- Tensions are drawn from the end of the string towards the middle 
$$T_1^{->} = T_2^{->}$$
```
