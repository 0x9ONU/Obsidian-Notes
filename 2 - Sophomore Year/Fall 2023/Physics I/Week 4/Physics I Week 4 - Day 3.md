# Circular Motion Continued

```ad-example
Find the centripical acceleration given:
- $R= 10m$
- $V_A = V_B = 3 \frac{m}{s}$
```ad-check
title: Solution
$$a_{cp} = \frac{v^2}{R}$$ 
$$a_{cp} = \frac{(3)^2}{10} = 0.9 \frac{m}{s^2}$$ 
```

## Tangential Acceleration

Responsible of the change  for the change of magnitude/speed of the velocity vector

$$a_t = tangential \space acceleration $$
$$a_t = \frac{\Delta v}{\Delta t} = \frac{V_B-V_A}{\Delta t}$$

```ad-important
The tangential acceleration will be constant throughout the entire circle
```

```ad-example
Given $V_A = 2 \frac{m}{s}$, $V_B = 5 \frac{m}{s}$, and $\Delta t = 1.5 s$:
1. Find Tangential accleration.
2. What is the overall acceleration in point A?
3. What is the overall acceleration in point B?

```ad-check
title: Solution
- Tangential Acceleration
	- $a_t = \frac{5-2}{1.5} = 2 \frac{m}{s^2}$
- Overall aceleration in Point A
	- Find centripical acceleration
		- $a_{cp} = \frac{V_A^2}{R}$
		- $a_{cp} = \frac{2^2}{10} = 0.4 \frac{m}{s^2}$
	- Find tangential acceleration
		- $a_t = 2 \frac{m}{s^2}$
	- Find combined acceleration
		- $a_A = \sqrt{a_{cp}^2+a_t^2}$
		- $a_A = \sqrt{(0.4)^2 + 2^2} = 2.04 \frac{m}{s^2}$
- Overall acceleration in Point B
	- Find centripical acceleration
		- $a_{cp} = \frac{V_A^2}{R}$
		- $a_{cp} = \frac{5^2}{10} = 2.5 \frac{m}{s^2}$
	- Find tangential acceleration
		- $a_t = 2 \frac{m}{s^2}$
	- Find combined acceleration
		- $a_B = \sqrt{a_{cp}^2+a_t^2}$
		- $a_B = \sqrt{(2.5)^2 + 2^2} = 3.2 \frac{m}{s^2}$

# Dynamics Introduction

```ad-summary
Dynamics is the study of forces
```

Dynamics and Mechanics are fundamentally based on Newton's Three Laws

```ad-note
They are the fundamental laws that cannot be derived further into simpler laws
```

## Newton's Laws (1687)

### Newton's First Law -  The Law of Inertia

An object at rest or rectilinear uniform motion will remain in that state of rest or motion for an indefinite time if there is no force acts upon that object.

```ad-summary
title: Inertia
The property of an object to **oppose** to any change of its state of rest or rectilinear uniform motion 
```

```ad-important
The mass of an object is a measure of the inertia of the object
```

#### Distinction Between Inertial and Non-Inertial Reference Frames

Sometimes, an object may accelerate in a strange direction, which goes against the law of inertia.


### Newton's Second Law - The Law of Acceleration

The  force applied to the object and the mass of the object is directly responsible for an object's acceleration.

$$a = \frac{F}{m}$$

$$F^{->} = ma^{->}$$

```ad-summary
$${F}_{si} = kg*\frac{m}{s^2} = N$$
```

```ad-note
Acceleration will always be in the **same** orientation as the force
![[CamScanner 09-20-2023 20.28_2.jpg]]
```

```ad-important
- If multiple forces are acting upon an object, the sum of the vectors applied to it will be used in the equation
- The acceleration will have the **same orientation** as the resultant vector
![[CamScanner 09-20-2023 20.28_3.jpg]]
$$F^{->}_1 + F^{->}_2  F^{->}_3 = R^{->} = ma^{->}$$
```

### Newton's Third Law: The Law of Action-Reaction

![[CamScanner 09-20-2023 20.29_1.jpg]]
$$ m_1 = 70 kg \space \space m_2 = 50kg$$

```ad-important
$$F_{1, 2} = F_{2, 1}$$
$$F_{1, 2}^{->} = -F_{2, 1}^{->}$$
```

```ad-warning
Be aware of the point of application of where the forces are applied. Can determine if it is action-reaction or two forces that create equilibrium
```

```ad-note
The object with less mass will travel **farther** towards the other object:
$$F = ma$$
$$100N = 50kg * a_2 = a_2 = 2 \frac{m}{s^2}$$
$$100N = 70kg * a_1 = a_1 = 1.43 \frac{m}{s^2}$$
```
