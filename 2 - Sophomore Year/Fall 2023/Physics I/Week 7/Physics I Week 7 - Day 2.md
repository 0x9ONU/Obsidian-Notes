```ad-note
For our examples so far, the force has always had a constant value to create the displacement
- BUT, there can be a variable force
```

# Variable Force

$$ F^{->} = ax\hat{i} => variable$$

#comebacklater ex. 1

```ad-note
While the force acts upon the object, its **magnitude** changes
```

It can be broken down into small bits of work based on:
$$dW = F^{->} * dr^{->}$$

```ad-important
You need to use integration of the path to find the total work
$$W = \int_A^B F^{->} d * r^{->}$$
```

```ad-note
This equation is general and can be used to calculate almost any amount of work
```

## Example

```ad-question
Moves the object along x-axis from $x_A = 4m$ to $x_B = 7m$

$$F^{->} = 3x\hat{i}$$
```

- Use integration:

$$W = \int_A^B F^{->} * dr^{->} =  \int_A^B(3x\hat{i}) * (dx\hat{i} + dy\hat{j})$$

$$W = \int_A^B 3xdx = 3 \int_4^7 xdx = 3 |\frac{x^2}{2} |_4^7$$
$$W = 3 * \frac{49}{2} = 3*\frac{16}{2} = 49.5 J$$


## Geometrical Interpretation of Work

# Energy 

```ad-summary
Objects which posess energy are capable of doing work.
```

```ad-example
title: Types of Energy
- Kinetic Energy (KE)
	- Energy of objects in motion
	- $KE = \frac{1}{2} mV^2$
- Potential Energy (U)
	- Gravitational Potential Energy
		- $U = mgh$
		- $h = \space height$
	- Elastic Potential Energy
		- $U = \frac{1}{2} kx^2$
		- $k = \space spring \space constant$
		- $x$ is the deformation of the spring
- The Mechanical Energy (E)
	- The sum of kinetic and potential energy
	- $E = KE + U$
```

```ad-important
All types of energy are measured in **Joules** ($\dot{J}$) as well
```
