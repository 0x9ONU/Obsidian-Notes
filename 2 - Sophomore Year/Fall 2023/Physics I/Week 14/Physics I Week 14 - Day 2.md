# Specific Heat Capacity ($c$)
$$Q\sim m; \Delta t$$
$$\therefore Q = m*c*\Delta t$$

```ad-important
$$\frac{Q}{m\Delta t}$$
Represents the amount of energy required to increase $1kg$ of a substance by $1 K$
```

```ad-note
$$[c]_{si} = \frac{\dot{J}}{kg K} = \frac{\dot{J}}{kg \degree C}$$
```

## Examples

### Example 1:

![[Physics I Week 14 - Day 2 2023-11-29 10.12.38.excalidraw]]

**Given**:
- $m_{Al} = 0.105kg$
- $m_w = 0.185kg$
- $m_{glass}=0.017kg$
- $m_x = 0.215kg$
- $t_i = 10.5 \degree C$
- $t_{ix} = 330 \degree C$
- $t_{equilibrium} = 35 \degree C$

**Using Formula, Graph**

$$Q = mc \Delta t$$

![[Physics I Week 14 - Day 2 2023-11-29 10.18.30.excalidraw]]

```ad-important
$$|Q_{Released by Hot Object}| = Q_{abs by Al} + Q_{abs by w} + Q{abs by glass}$$
```

**Plug in Values**

$$|0.215kg * c_x*(35 \degree C - 330 \degree C)| = [(0.105kg)(900 \frac{\dot{J}}{kg \degree C})(35 \degree C - 10.5 \degree C)] + [(0.185kg)(4186 \frac{\dot{J}}{kg \degree C}(35 \degree C-10.4 \degree C)]+[(0.017kg)(840 \frac{\dot{J}}{kg \degree C})(35 \degree C - 10.5 \degree C)]$$

```ad-note
All kg and degrees cancel out leaving only Joules ($\dot{J}$)
```

$$63.43 c_x = 2315.25 + 18973+349.86$$
$$c_x = 341.16 \frac{\dot{J}}{kg \degree C}$$

## Sign Convention for Heat

- $Q$ absorbed by a system is positive
- $Q$ released by a system is negative

# Latent Heat

Happens when a substance is in the middle of a phase change (ex. from gas to liquid or solid to liquid)
- When this happens, it does not change temperature, but changes its phase until ALL the object is converted

![[Physics I Week 14 - Day 2 2023-11-29 10.37.17.excalidraw]]

$$Q = mL$$
```ad-note
$$L_[si] = \frac{\dot{J}}{kg}$$
```

## Table of Latent Heats

## Examples:

### Example: 1

```ad-question
What is the $Q$ to melt ice ($m_{ice}=0.005kg$) from $-5 \degree C$ up to steam $100 \degree C$?
```

**Graph for Visualization**

![[Physics I Week 14 - Day 2 2023-11-29 10.43.19.excalidraw]]

$$Q = mc \Delta t + mL_f + mc \Delta t + mL_v$$
$$Q = (0.005 kg) * 2100 \frac{\dot{J}}{kg \degree C}(0-(-5))\degree C + 0.005kg *333,000\frac{\dot{J}}{kg} + (0.005kg)*4186 \frac{\dot{J}}{kg \degree C}(100-0)\degree C + (0.005kg)(2,260,000 \frac{\dot{J}}{kg})$$

$$Q = 15110.5  \dot{J}$$
