# Overview

## Classical Physics
- Discovered prior to 1900
- Physics I and II covers all of classical physics
- Physics I Covers mechanics and thermal dynamics
- Physics II covers the rest 

## Modern Physics
- After 1900
- Covered by other classes
- Theory of relativity, quantum mechanics, etc.

## Mechanics
- Motion of objects

Broken into the following:
### Kinematics
- Particles 
	- Only has mass and moves
- Study of motion of particles 
- Describes the motion of particles in space and time
- Point-like

```ad-important
*IGNORES THE AGENT THAT PRODUCED THE MOTION AKA FORCES*
```
### Dynamics
- Focuses specifically on the forces created
- Utilizes many drawings and Newton's 2nd law
	- Work
	- Energy
	- Impulses

```ad-note
Causes kinematics
```
### Statics
- Study of equilibrium
- Static vs. dynamic

# Units Review

## Physical Quantity

```ad-summary
All qualities that can be measured in relation to a chosen unit
```

```ad-example
- Length (m, ft)
- Mass (lbs, kg)
- Time (s, m, h)
- Force (J)
- Acceleration ($m/s^2$)
```

## International Unit System (SI)
- Created in 1960 in France

```ad-important
title: All Major SI Units
$$[length]_{si} = m$$
$$[time]_{si} = s$$
$$[mass]_{si} = kg$$
$$[velocity]_{si} = frac{m}{s}$$
$$[force]_{si} = kg * \frac{m}{s^2} = N$$
```ad-note
- Length SI is NOT cm and mass SI is NOT g
- $N = Newton$
```

**Fundamental Units**: Units that cannot be further broken down into smaller units
- Only seven fundamental units exist
- Five are covered in this semester
	- Length ($m$)
		- Mechanical
	- Time ($s$)
		- Mechanical
	- Mass ($kg$)
		- Mechanical
	- Temperature ($K$)
		- Thermal
	- Quantity of substance ($mol$)
	- Ampere ($A$)
	- Candela ($cd$)

**Supplemental Units**: Units that are created by a combination fundamental units
- Ex. velocity and force
