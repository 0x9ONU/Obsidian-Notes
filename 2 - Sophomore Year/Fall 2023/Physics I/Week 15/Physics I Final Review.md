# Pendulum Problem

```ad-question
A pendulum consists of a bob of mass $m=0.5kg$ attached to a string of length $2m$. The bob is pulled aside so that the string makes an angle of $30 \degree$ with the vertical, and is relased from rest. As it passe dhtorugh bottom of the arc, what is the speed of the bob?

**Find Energy**

$$E_A = E_B$$

$$mgh = \frac{1}{2}mV_B^2$$
$$h = 2-2\cos(30 \degree)$$

$$V_B = \sqrt(2 * 9.8 2(1-\cos(30 \degree) = 2.29 \frac{m}{s}$$
# Frictionless Inclined Plane

```ad-question
A mass of $2kg$ is launched up a fricitonless inclined plane (of angle $\theta = 40 \degree) with an inital speed of 5 $\frac{m}{s}$
- How far along the inclined plane will ig et before it starts sliding donw?
- What is the spee dof the mass after it had travlled $1m$ up the inclinded plane?

**Part A**
$$E_A=E_B$$
$$\frac{1}{2}mV_A^2 = mgh_B$$
$$h_b = \frac{\frac{1}{2}V_A^2}{g}= \frac{\frac{1}{2}(5)^2}{9.8}$$
$$\sin(40 \degree) = \frac{h_b}{A_B} \rightarrow AB = \frac{h_b}{\sin(40 \degree)} = \frac{1.28}{\sin40 \degree} = 1.99 m$$

**Part B**

$$E_A = E_C$$
$$\frac{1}{2} m V_A^2 = \frac{1}{2}mV_C^2+ mgh_c$$
$$h_c = 1m * \sin40 \degree = 0.64 m$$
$$V_A^2 = V_c^2 + 2 gh_c$$
$$V_C = \sqrt{V_A^2 - 2gh_c} \Rightarrow V_C = 3??? \frac{m}{s}$$

$$F_{muscl.} = mg$$
$$P = \frac{W}{\Delta t} = \frac{F_{muscl}*d*\cos(0 \degree)}{\Delta t} = \frac{(80m)(9.8 \frac{m}{s^2})(12m)}{8s} = 1176 \space W$$

$$v_{i\space glass} = v_{iw} = 450 ml$$
$$t_i = 100 \degree C; t_f = 20 \degree C$$

**Find Glass Expansion**
$$v_{f \space glass} = v_{i \space glass} (1 + 3 \alpha \Delta t)$$
$$v_{f \space glass} = 450mL(1+3(9*10^{-6} \frac{1}{C \degree} *(20-100)\degree C) = 449.028 mL$$
**Find Water Expansion**
$$v_{fw} = v_{iw}(1 + \beta \Delta t)$$
$$v_{fw} - 450mL(1+ (210*10^{-6})(20-100) = 442.440 mL$$
**Find Amount of Water Added**

$$v_{is \space added} = 449.028 mL - 442440 mL = 6.588 mL$$

**Al Cup**

$$Q_{Al} +Q_{w} = Q_{cu}$$

$$m_{Al} c_{Al}(t_{eq}-12)+m_wc_w(t_{eq}-12) = |m_{cu}c_{cu}(t_{eq}-245)|$$

```ad-important
Flip the 245 with $t_{eq}$ to solve for the absolute value
```

$$(.145)(900)(t_{eq}-12)+(0.825)(4186)(t_{eq}-12) = (0.265)(390)(245-t_{eq})$$
$$130.5t_{eq} + -1566 + 3453.45 t_{eq} - 41,441 = 25,320.75 - 103.35t_{eq}$$
$$3687.3 t_{eq} = 68327.75$$
$$t_{eq} = 18.5 \degree C$$

# Kinetic Theory

$$v_{rms} = \sqrt{\frac{3RT}{M}}$$
$$ = \sqrt{\frac{3R*303.15K}{M}}$$
$$v_{3\space rms} = 3 \sqrt{\frac{3R*303.15}{M}} = \sqrt{\frac{3RT_2}{M}}$$

```ad-important
Square both equations
```

$$9* \frac{3R(303.15)}{M} = \frac{3RT_2}{M}$$
$$T_2 = 9*303.15 = 2,729.35 (K)$$
$$t_2 = 2,455.2 \degree C$$
# 1st Law of Thermodynamics

**This is an Isobaric Transformation as the pressure is constant**

$$Q = W + \Delta E_{int}$$
$$W = p \Delta V$$
$$W = 1.013 * 10^5 \frac{N}{m^2}(4.1m^3-2.2m^3)$$
$$W = 192, 470 \dot{J}$$
**Q is positive since it is ADDEDDD**

$$\Delta E_{int} = Q - W$$
$$= 6.8*10^5 \dot{J}-1.9247 * 10^5 \dot{J} = 4.875 *10^5\dot{J}$$
