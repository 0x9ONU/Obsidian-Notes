# Centripetal Force

```ad-example
title: Review
#comebacklater ex. 1

```ad-check
title: Solution
- Along y-axis
	- $N - mg = ma_y$ Set $a_y = 0$
	- $N = mg$
```

**BUT what if it was in a valley**

#comebacklater ex. 2

Forces along y-axis:
$$ N -mg = ma_y$$

```ad-important
A circular motion ALWAYS has centripical acceleration **along the radius**
$$ a_y = a_{cp}$$
```

$$N - mg = m * (\frac{V^2}{R})$$

```ad-note
The combination of the normal force and mass and gravity play a role in creating the centripical force of an object.
```

```ad-warning
**DO NOT** draw the centripical force. It is a combination of multiple forces that have already been drawn.
```

**What if it was a hill?**

#comebacklater ex. 3

Forces along y-axis:

$$-N + mg = m \frac{v^2}{R}$$
$$N = mg - m\frac{v^2}{R}$$

```ad-note
The lightness depends on when $N = 0$ as it no longer pushes against the road. Solving for $v$ can get you the $v_{max}$ of where you are no longer on the road
```

## Examples

### Ball Spinning Around a Radius with a String

#comebacklater ex. 4

```ad-check
title: Solution
- Draw Three forces
- Create sum of forces:
	- $N^{->} + T^{->} + mg^{->} = ma^{->}$
- Along Y-axis
	- $N + 0 - mg = ma_y$
	- $N -mg = 0$
	- $N = mg$
- Along X-axis
	- $0 + T + 0 = ma_x$
	- $T = m\frac{V^2}{R}$
- Find Max Speed
	- $(75) = (0.45)\frac{v_{max}^2}{(1.3)}$
	- 166.67 = \frac{v_{max}^2}{1.3}$
	- $v_{max}^2 = 216.67$
	- $v_{max} = 14.72 \frac{m}{s}$
```

### Car From Behind Turning

#comebacklater ex. 5

```ad-important
A force of static friciton keeps the car from skidding
- It plays the role of centripical force
```

```ad-check
title: Solution
- Write Sum of Forces
	- $N^{->} + mg^{->} + ma^{->}$
- Along x axis
	- $N - mg = 0$
	- $N = mg$
- Along x axis
	- $F_s = ma_x = m \frac{v^2}{R}$
- Impose $F_{smax} = M_{s}N$
	- $M_s * mg = m * \frac{V_{max}^2}{R}$
	- $V_{max} = \sqrt{M_sgR}$
```
