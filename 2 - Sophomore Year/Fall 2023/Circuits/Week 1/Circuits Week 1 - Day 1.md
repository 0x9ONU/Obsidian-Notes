# Scientific vs. Engineering Notation

**Scientific** - any number that has one digit after the decimal place

```ad-example
$435.2*10^1$
```

**Engineering** - any number that has specific number with *multiples of three*

```ad-example
color: 255, 255, 0
$4.352 * 10^3$
```

## Engineering Notation Table

| Exponent   | Unit  | Abr. |
| ---------- | ----- | ---- |
| $10^{-12}$ | Pico  | p    |
| $10^{-9}$  | Nano  | n    |
| $10^{-6}$  | Micro | $M$  |
| $10^{-3}$  | milli | m    |
| $10^3$     | Kilo  | K    |
| $10^6$     | Mega  | M    |
| $10^9$     | Giga  | G     |

# Basic Electric Quantities

**Voltage (V)**: 
- The energy per unit charge that is created by charge separation
-  Volts (V)
- $V= \frac{dW}{dq}$
	- $dW = Energy (j)$
	- $dq = charge (C)$
