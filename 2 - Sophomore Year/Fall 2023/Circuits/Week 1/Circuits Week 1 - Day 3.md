# Ohm's Law

The voltage drop across a _resistor_ is proportional to the value of the current flowing through it

$$ v = Ri$$

```ad-note
**Resistance**: The property of a material that oppose the flow of current. 
- Measured in ohm (Ω)
```

**Conductance**: It is the property of a material to conduct current
- The inverse (reciprocal) of resistance. 
- Measured in seimens (s) or mho (℧)
```

## Ohm's Law Formulas

```ad-summary
The following formulas can be derived from Ohm's Law:
- $i = \frac{v}{R}$
- $R = \frac{v}{i}$
```

```ad-important
Further, using the Power formula ($P = vi$):
- $P = i^2R$
	- Find power knowing current and resistance
- $P = \frac{v^2}{R}$
	- Find power knowing voltage and resistance
```

## Short Circuit & Open Circuit

When resistance = 0 or $v=0$, there is a short circuit.

When resistance = $\infty$ or $i=0$, there is an open circuit
