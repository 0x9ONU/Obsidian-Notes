# What is Machine Learning?

Teaches computers to learn from experience:
- Machine learning algorithms use computational methods to "learn" information directly from data *without relying on a predetermined equation as a model*.
- The algorithm adaptively improves their performance as the number of samples available for learning increases.

Machine Learning is the study of algorithms that:
- Improve their **Performance** P
- at some **task** T
- with **experience** E
```

```ad-example
A Machine Learning program that can learn to flag spam emails given spam and non-spam emails
- Performance **P** can be given by thre ratio of correctly classified emails
- Task **T** is flagging spam for new emails
- Experience **E** can be given as the provided training data
```

**Training Set**
- A set of example the system uses to learn 
**Training Instance**
- Each training example

## Benefits of Machine Learning

- Automation
	- Machine learning can automate tasks that would otherwise require human intervention
- Improved accuracy
	- Machine learning algorithms can identify patterns in data that humans might miss, leading to more accurate predictions and decisions
- Handling Complex Data
	- ML can handle large and complex data sets that are difficult or impossible for humans to process.
- Predictive Analysis
	- ML can be used to make predictions about future events, allowing organizations to make proactive decisions
- Cost-effective
	- ML can reduce labor costs and increase efficiency, leading to cost saving for organizations
