# Ways to Obtain Datasets for Machine Learning

- Public Datasets
	- Many organizations and research groups make their datasets publicly available for use in machine learning projects
- Scraping
	- You can also use web scraping tools to collect data from websites. This can be useful for obtaining data that is not publicly available in a structured format.
- Creating your own
	- Collect your own data, either by creating a dataset yourself or by working with a company or organization taht has access to the data you need.
- Purchase
	- You also have the option to purchase datasets, either from data vendors or other companies that sell datasets for specific use cases

# Datasets

A collection of organized data. It can take various forms, from a series of arrays to a database table.

Knowing the suitable dataset for each kind of machine learning is crucial
```

## Types of Datasets

**Tabular dataset**
- Similar to a database table or matrix
- Each column represents a specific variable
- Each row represents the fields within the dataset.
- CSV is the most common type

**Real-world dataset**
- Large and unwieldly
- Difficult to process
- Often use smaller, simplified datasets to learn machine learning

```ad-example
title: Data types for datasets
- Numerical Data (integers, decimals)
- Categorical data (strings, labels)
- Binary data (true/false, 0/1)
- Text data (written words, comments)
- Image data (pictures, phtographs)
- Audio data (sound recordings)
- Video data (footage, movies)
```
