## Definition of Computer Security

```ad-note
Difficult to define as there are complexities associated with it
```

Can be closer to be defined as information security:
- The information being protected from unauthorized access or alteration 
- Is still available to authorized individuals when required

Make sure to consider how information dealt with as each one of these layers needs their own protection schemes:
- stored
- processed
- transferred between machines
